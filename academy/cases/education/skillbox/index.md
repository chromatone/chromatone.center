In 2021 we've been working with the educational platform called [SkillBox](https://skillbox.ru) on an [11 modules video course](/academy/materials/ru/skillbox/index.md) that leads beginners from basic light and sound physics through intervals and scales up to the level of music composition techniques. Each module consists of 3-5 lessons 15-30 minutes each. We go through all the topics with the use of Chromatone web-apps and different instruments. Learners get custom designed sticker sheets from the company by mail and have some instrumental videos to shoot for the homework.
