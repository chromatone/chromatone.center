Chromatone is ready to be used in a multitude of music educational products like courses, workshops, posters, stickers and, of course, web-apps. We are ready to get involved in any of these directions and we are glad to meet new companies to collaborate with. 

## Educational content

> We are open for educational content collaborations. Chromatone is the platform to produce it for different audiences. In HQ and with music theory expertise.

### SkillBox video course

In 2021 we've been working with the educational platform called [SkillBox](https://skillbox.ru) on an [11 modules video course](../../academy/materials/ru/skillbox/index.md) that leads beginners from basic light and sound physics through intervals and scales up to the level of music composition techniques. Each module consists of 3-5 lessons 15-30 minutes each. We go through all the topics with the use of Chromatone web-apps and different instruments. Learners get custom designed sticker sheets from the company by mail and have some instrumental videos to shoot for the homework.

## Web-apps

> The open-source parts of Chromatone are ready to use in a multitude of variegated educational and emotional experiences. And building them makes Chromatone even better! 

### Playtronica web experience

In 2022 we started our web-app collaboration with [Playtronica](https://playtronica.com). They're building MIDI controllers and we're building an interactive audio-visual playground web application together - the [TouchMe Experience](./../../apps/experiment/touchme/index.md). 

## Music video production

### tsoop

[tsoop.ru](https://tsoop.ru) is an improvisational electronic music project with visualizations based on Chromatone system. There's a couple of albums published, but the main focus is on live collaborative music events. It's the research about what else can we can perform together.  ü•Å
