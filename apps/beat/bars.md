Create any number of metronome bars and manipulate it in many ways. Change the meter, mute any step, change the sound, panning or volume of each bar separately. But the most powerful thing is the divisions of any step – just click and drag the bottom of any beat to subdivide it into any number of steps. Compose very complex patterns with triplets, quadriplets, quintuplets and more. You can even mute any of the subdivisions – pure rhythmic freedom to play and to see. Change the BPM by dragging the tempo info at the top right.
