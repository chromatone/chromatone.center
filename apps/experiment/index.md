Here's our collection of various web music experiments built by us or other creators. 

Here's the universal [Fretboard calculator](./fretboard/index.md) that may help you build your own custom fretted string instrument with any given dimestions. 

We haven't ported the fabulous [MIDI Paper](./paper/index.md) visualizer yet, but you may play with it standalone. The [Sound Laboratory](./lab/index.md) is another powerful standalone tool to explore basic sound synthesis and effect chains. Some even more old experiments are at [Dev](./dev/index.md).

There's a couple of work in progress tools like the [Spectrum analyzer](./spectrum/index.md) and [Euclidean rhythm generator](./euclid/index.md).

And there's a ever growing collection of [Other music web-apps](./other/index.md) found on the internet.
