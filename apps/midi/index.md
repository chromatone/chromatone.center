MIDI is the global standard for transfering music information. It's a protocol, that consists of small realtime commands, that you can observe with any MIDI-enabled browser and MIDI conroller connected to your device with the [MIDI Log app](./log/index.md).

[MIDI Router](./router/index.md) may help you transfer messages from certain inputs to certain outputs for building even quite complex setups. All the notes played and all the knobs changed are nicely visualised in the [MIDI monitor](./monitor/index.md) or drawn on an endless [MIDI Roll](./roll/index.md). And if we loop the roll around a central axis, we get the [MIDI radar](./radar/index.md) that spins at the speed of current clock signal and marks all events on the circular timeline.

If you've found some nice melodic or harmonic moves and want to save it for later - try the [MIDI Recorder](./recorder/index.md). Save the .mid files to your device and analyze them later with the experimental [MIDI File Visualizer](./visualizer/index.md)
