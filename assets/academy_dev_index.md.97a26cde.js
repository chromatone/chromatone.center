So here's my first deep dive into DSP coding with Elementary.\\n\\nhttps://www.elementary.audio\\n\\nDuring these 2 hours coding session I was digging the docs and building a basic polyphonic synth. It needs to be running on mobile devices glitch-free for me to start seriously considering using this library in something more than just an experiment. And it happened!\\n\\nI've managed to write a Vue 3 Composable function that mounts with any component and establishes a proper MIDI-synth with multiple sine voices and a volume knob. We've went through the initial challenges and I've shown my thought and code design process. You can follow the component development here:  https://github.com/chromatone/chromatone.center\\n\\nAnd see the final result at https://chromatone.center/practice/midi/synth/\\n","date":"2023-06-23","slug":"explore-elementary","cover":"https://db.chromatone.center/assets/0848e053-2965-4ea2-9f89-607fec3c5aee","youtube_video":"eCCDmcbgcR8"},"url":"explore-elementary"},{"frontmatter":{"id":1,"status":"published","sort":null,"title":"Audio engine build","description":"Step by step web audio development with newly open sources Web DSP","content":"<youtube-embed video=\\"7f8RgJf3A0E\\" />\\n\\nA couple of weeks past from previous video about just the first steps in exporation of the newly opened to public Elementary audio library. Now we got some progress with a number of layers of Vue 3 composables that are used to render UI and audio.\\n\\nIn this video we'll be exploring the architecture of a polyphonic synthesizer, drum machine and all the beautiful audio analysis tools, that act like probes in audio graph. We share some insight on how to make all of these functions as pluggable and composable as possible.\\n\\nIt's not a final product, it's just a snapshot of days of research and experimentation. I made it for other web audio enthusiasts to have this example as a reference for the ideation and build process. And soon all these functionalities will come to every page of the site and even further to the \`use-chromatone\` NPM package and thousands of new modules and web based music projects.\\n","date":"2023-07-23","slug":"audio-engine-build","cover":"https://db.chromatone.center/assets/3863d1da-1e73-47e7-853d-afd5deaf523e","youtube_video":"7f8RgJf3A0E"},"url":"audio-engine-build"},{"frontmatter":{"id":4,"status":"published","sort":null,"title":"Academy update","description":"Major updates to the Chromatone web-site, May 2022","content":"<youtube-embed video=\\"ltMBUZFM20s\\" />\\n\\n### 2022-05-18: Academy update\\n\\nChromatone got some significant updates this may. Now it's not just a web-site to learn and explore music theory. It's a whole ecosystem of tools to learn, teach and analyze music. Besides all the articles and interactive apps now we have the audio and video recording tools to produce educational content right in the browser. Play notes with your mouse, touch, keyboard or MIDI controller. Connect your mic, synth or audio interface and have the the sound analyzed, processed and recorded along with the video of your front camera and the screen.\\n\\nIt's a musician toolbox that is the foundation for the whole Chromatone academy - the community of educators and their materials to learn with. The next goal is to start teaching and verifying new Chromatone educators all over the world to bring it to any remote region in any language and musical culture.\\n\\n    00:00 Chromatone - the visual way to learn music\\n    00:40 Music theory web experience\\n    1:15 Educational materials production web tools\\n    2:15 Drawing on pages\\n    3:35 Jamming and composing together\\n    4:20 Interactive logo and keyboard synth\\n    4:52 Synth oscillators\\n    5:10 Quantization\\n    6:04 Rhythm circles - the polyrhythmic metronome\\n    6:40 Euclidean rhythms\\n    7:38 Download MIDI\\n    7:48 Record audio\\n    8:15 Audio effects\\n    8:30 MIDI panel\\n    8:57 Colorful spectrogram\\n    9:29 Awful singing to show the vocal overtones\\n    9:50 Formants visualization \\n    10:05 Pitch roll\\n    11:10 Drone generator\\n    12:20 Academy and it's educators\\n    12:50 Understanding music is beyond colors\\n    13:00 Online course and partnerships\\n    13:30 App collaborations\\n    14:00 Meet and jam together with colors\\n    14:40 Mission to build and to sustain\\n    15:18 International academy\\n    16:00 Reach us!\\n","date":"2022-05-18","slug":"academy-update","cover":"https://db.chromatone.center/assets/f068b75b-8937-4e38-b8ce-ccf8b1dd8d11","youtube_video":"ltMBUZFM20s"},"url":"academy-update"}]`),d=e("p",null,"This exact web-site is a huge undertaking, that has years of focused development invested in it.
