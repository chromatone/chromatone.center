I use illustrations, videos and interactive web-apps to teach people of all ages and any level of prior music knowledge. I can visualize almost any music theory concept on which we can elaborate to produce a much deeper understanding of these concepts in your mind. My main focus is on live improvisation skills that can be developed gradually and with comfort of modern technology. So I hope to help grow more free and independent musicianship.","interactions":["Online guidance","One-on-one sessions","Group lessons","Lectures","Improvisations","Performances"],"book":"https://airtable.com/shrFbtdCJR07jDsaM"}]},"headers":[],"relativePath":"academy/educators/index.md","filePath":"academy/educators/index.md"}`),l={name:"academy/educators/index.md"},h=d('<p>We&#39;re building an international community of the visual music theory teachers and practitioners.
