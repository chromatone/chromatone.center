Last time we made our first music instrument - the single string bottle guitar and then had quite a jam with it as a bass and solo. This time we are going to upgrade it with a new string and a bent neck to have even more fun with it.</p><p>Any visitor of the meetup can have a short talk about any of their interest in music and then we explore the topic deeper together. Eventually we come up with our next build idea. Compose a song, build a synth setup, or may be build some new percussion for us to play? Let&#39;s decide together! No music skills required. Basic English is enough to start. And yeah, the event is free! So if you’re interested in any way of music - see you among us this Thursday at 7pm in Pirate Bay, Phuket town.</p><hr><ul><li>Improved guitar with the curved neck and new string.</li><li>Learned Sondown song <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atcNf8zBB3M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sundown video</a> song</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGuLWL48o-c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sundown ENG video</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thechordtab.com/%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B5-%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%95-%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C/%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%94-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%87-%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sundown chords</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr>',5),P={key:2},T={key:3,class:"max-w-55ch"},M=t("tr",{class:"text-xl font-bold p-4"},[t("td",{colspan:"3"},"Schedule")],-1),x={width:"60px",class:"text-center"},A={width:"50%"},j={class:"opacity-60"},S=t("h2",{id:"project",tabindex:"-1"},[l("Project "),t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#project","aria-label":'Permalink to "Project"'},"​")],-1),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"MGM#7","description":"Bottle guitar upgraded","frontmatter":{"dynamic":true,"id":"91317ac7-42ce-471d-bd26-79cad09375f8","status":"published","sort":null,"user_created":"796b4fbf-a0d9-4eac-998a-49bf3f9ffe65","date_created":"2023-08-19T09:20:11.071Z","user_updated":"796b4fbf-a0d9-4eac-998a-49bf3f9ffe65","date_updated":"2023-09-01T18:08:01.279Z","title":"MGM#7","date":"2023-02-02","start_time":"19:00:00","description":"Bottle guitar upgraded","youtube_video":"rB7gyPbYatM","live_stream":null,"cover":"https://db.chromatone.center/assets/9b6b2ba3-ee45-419b-ad37-11239a511c30?fit=cover&format=webp&width=1000","slug":"7","announcement":null,"poster":"bca09676-d8fa-4077-af83-7a33f5274367","audio":null,"url":null,"schedule":[{"time":"19:00:00","activity":"Talk","duration":"1 hour","type":"talk"},{"time":"20:00:00","activity":"Jam","duration":"1 hour","type":"jam"},{"time":"21:00:00","activity":"Create","duration":"45 min","type":"Performance"},{"time":"21:45:00","activity":"Recap","duration":"15 min","type":"Recap"}],"color":null,"duration":"3 hours","place":{"title":"Pirate Bay","city":"Phuket","country":"Thailand","logo":{"id":"8ec74b7e-9a0c-4362-9954-3e3c1a4bf527"}},"project":{"id":"0fde2a85-a24b-4446-b8ce-68e49a6c03e8","status":"published","sort":7,"user_created":"796b4fbf-a0d9-4eac-998a-49bf3f9ffe65","date_created":"2023-08-21T07:06:14.579Z","user_updated":"796b4fbf-a0d9-4eac-998a-49bf3f9ffe65","date_updated":"2023-08-23T08:50:46.491Z","title":"Music Geeks Meetups","description":"Weekly meetups for local musicians community.
