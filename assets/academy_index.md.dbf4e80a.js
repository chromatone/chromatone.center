The knowledge is stored in the articles and apps, but it&#39;s compressed and dryed out to be light and compact. But there&#39;s so much to dive in! And that&#39;s where guidance may be incredibly helpful.</p><p>We&#39;re building from the ground up, educating ourselves and the ones who want to participate in the early development. While Chromatone is developed for more than 4 years it&#39;s still a long way to have it finished. It becomes more of a process of distilling and transfering knowledge and joy.</p><p>Chromatone as the music itself is totally international and doesn&#39;t rely on any language (except JavaScript ðŸ˜‡). Our goal is to create an international community of teachers, learners and practitioners of our visual music approach. It has already recommended itself in music theory educational video production and the time has come for it expand worldwide. <a href="./projects/">Project</a> by project.</p><h2 id="where-are-we-going" tabindex="-1">Where are we going <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-are-we-going" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where are we going&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>First step is to establish the convenient way for <a href="./tutors/">tutors</a> to meet their students. Then educators will start creating their own content with all the tools available. In any language and for any age and any level of prior musical knowledge.</p><p>Second step is for all the educated people to gather together and play some amazing live music. Once you&#39;re in, you know it&#39;s a whole experience bringing deep joy of being in sync with each other! For that we hold meetups and other <a href="./events/">events</a>. It&#39;s our testing ground for new music collaboration formats.</p><p>Third step is to make such musical gatherings a part of the new post-scarcity culture worldwide. Chromatone makes music much easier for visual people to learn and practice, so it enables significantly more musicians in any given place. So there&#39;s always someone to jam with! ðŸ¤© And everyone should be able to meet other musicians and improvise together for a couple of hours at least once a week or two. ðŸª—</p><hr><p>On this journey we meet great partners that start implementing the Chromatone music notation system and it&#39;s code. It&#39;s becoming more and more developed and ready to use in many new ways.</p>',10),A=JSON.parse('{"title":"Academy","description":"People are great in helping other people learn.
