The format is a blend of presentation, workshop, and performance. Entry is free + donations are encouraged. \\n\\nFirst we'll explore musical elements from basic notes to complex rhythms using our innovative web-apps. Then after a coffee & networking break we'll enjoy **tsoop** live audio-visual performance and then walk through the process of creating such multimedia experiences step by step together. And if you're moved by the music, you might even find yourself in an impromptu jam session!\\n\\nThe event is designed for everyone.

The almost uninterrupted row of meetups is coming to the turning point. August 2023 is the last month Pirate Bay Phuket exists as a place to host free and open events. Quite rural island, especially during low tourist season can't compete with vivid Asian cities. Glenn, who mafe Pirate Bay possible, moves on with other projects in different places of the world.  It's time to collect all the experience we've gained with all these weekly gatherings and take it further.\\n\\nIt may be an end for a FabLab, but Chromatone is just at the very start! There are so many features to add and bugs to fix in the Chromatone web-site code base. These so much to teach, to learn and to explore with visual music language!  And there are so many people to reach out and get well with. There are ideas and plans on how to move on with our Music Geeks Meetups in other spaces. Let's see how it turns out!\\n\\nThis a bit longer recap was shot at once and then edited by our new member - Alex, a visual artist, who can appreciate the use of color as a means to get deep into music. It's so cool to see how music inspires visual creativity and vice versa. And it's the main case for Chromatone - to be a way to get on the same musical page for people of completely different levels of knowledge and skill.\\n\\nI tried to summarize the way these 34 meetups appeared for me and all the guests, who could get to Pirate Bay in these Thursday nights. It's a pleasure to have a 3 hour meeting with other people interested in deep music explorations.\\n\\nFirst hour to set and tune everything up and get in a proper mood. Share ideas and explorations. And discuss upcoming music. Yes, from 8 PM the jam starts and people start exploring all the possibilities to make pleasant sounds together. Free exchange of motifs, grooves and progressions. Nice time to share instruments and explore new territories.\\n\\nThe second part passes in no time! Everyone easily gets involved into music and just loses any sense of time. Very soon the quest is not how to start, but how to modulate and stop the jamming process. But there's more! Once revealed, new improvised moves may find their place in a more structured performances of the final third part of the meetup. It's purpose is to make something, that has a distinct form. A beginning and an end. A verse, a bridge, a chorus. A modulation or a dance. No actual limits are imposed. Just creative bounds to make room for everyone!\\n\\nLast 15 minutes are for the recap - shooting it on air. It's a way to fix the trace of all the emotions and joy that was experienced together. To share the knowledge with others in space and time. And to share music!\\n\\nThere's so much more to explore in this format and techniques. Let's see how it goes next!

Thus, they learn effectively at maximum speed.\\n\\n**We want this culture of hacking to become the norm in society.**\\n\\nWe’re working to **cultivate the hacker culture** for students, developers, and active citizens by building an **adventure playground** for creators to hack, play, and learn.\\n\\nWe believe in the combined power of active citizenship and lifelong kindergarten via the 4Ps of Creative Learning: Passions, Projects, Peers, and Play.\\n\\nWhen creators build things, it strengthens their magic - their ability to learn and create across disciplinary boundaries, to learn in public, to be creative, and to help them master and hone their practical skills, such as software engineering or biology.\\n\\nWe rely on four strategies to work towards our goal.\\n\\n- Help creators broaden their horizons and perspectives by exposing them to new technologies, disciplines, and problem domains.\\n\\n- Create automations and open-source technologies to solve problems for each community. We aim to develop open technology in collaboration with multiple communities, and have widespread adoption by multiple groups.\\n\\n- Connect creators and organizations via hackathons, open-source projects, game shows, initiatives, and meetups.\\n\\n- Raise awareness in other communities through media and science communication.\\n\\nWhen a creator takes the lead and collaborates with other communities, they can solve even greater problems. By connecting interdisciplinary communities to collaborate on projects, they are able to share resources, learn from other experts, and achieve their shared goals.\\n\\nThis inspires us to connect and grow creators and communities across disciplines by creating a Community Mesh, an interconnected network of communities with shared values of lifelong learning.\\n\\nThe incentive is for creators to meet their personal goals, for organizations to meet their goals, and for the wider community to meet their shared goals.\\n\\nWe aim to build a foundation for students and active citizens to solve their own problems, to be an adventure playground for creators to take the initiative in shaping our future.\\n\\n### A possible future\\n\\nWe envision a future where anyone can create to solve their own problems; where students and active citizens have the resources and knowledge they need, are able to collaborate creatively, and create even more.\\n\\nWe wish to cultivate the **garden of creators**; a community of lifelong learners constantly discovering new horizons and perspectives, building open-source technologies, collaborating with each other, and raising awareness through media and science communication.\\n\\nWe envision Creatorsgarten as a leading hub for Active Citizenship and Lifelong Learning, a place where creators can come to learn new skills, connect with others, and collaborate on projects. Where lifelong learning is not just a possibility, but a reality for all.\\n\\nWe aim to bridge communities across disciplines to connect and collaborate with one another. Therefore, communities can come together to achieve their shared goals.\\n\\nWe want to work towards building a strong, autonomous, collaborative, and decentralized foundation for active citizens in Thailand.\\n\\n### Who are we?\\n\\nWe are a diverse group of people who are united by our love for creating things. We believe that through the lens of creation and technology, we can discover the fun and beauty in everything around us.\\n\\nWe don’t believe in disciplinary boundaries. As we think that all knowledge is connected, and that by breaking down barriers we can learn more and create more interesting things.\\n\\nWe connect people through events, meetups, hackathons, and much more. We strive to create an environment where creators can come together to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from each other.\\n\\nWe stand for:\\n\\n**Creativity**: We believe that creativity is a fundamental human quality that should be nurtured and encouraged. We believe that everyone has the potential to be creative, and that the world is a better place when we all express our creativity.\\n\\n**Empathy**: We believe in putting ourselves in others’ shoes, and using our skills to make a positive impact on the world.\\n\\n**Fun**: We believe that work should be enjoyable, and that every day is an opportunity to learn something new and have some fun.\\n\\nThe name Creatorsgarten comes from the word creators and garten, as in kindergarten, which means garden of children in German. We chose this name because we want to create a garden for all creators where they can come to create, learn, and share.\\n\\nWe invite you to join us on this journey of exploration and creation. Together, let’s create things.","slug":"creatorsgarten","events":["829d7c02-c2f1-40de-8564-e2678925a059"],"projects":[18]},{"id":"50f7cb2d-2922-4695-b60a-a764f9942c35","status":"published","sort":5,"title":"Pirate Bay","url":"https://www.piratebayphuket.com/","social":"https://www.facebook.com/piratebayphuket","description":"On a tropical island of Phuket there's Pirate Bay - the new fablab space for makers of different crafts to meet and collaborate on creative projects.
