It will empower our music perception with vision, most humans primary sensory channel, especially in our modern screen time. Why not view music the visual way today? Let&#39;s explore 12 notes, 12 colors and infinite space of their possible combinations.</p><p>We&#39;ve discovered complete and coherent Visual Music Language there. It&#39;s evolving through further merging colors with notes, rhythms with shapes, intervals with gradients, chords and scales with palettes. And we pave the way for new generations of visual music explorers.</p><p>We&#39;re creating the Visual Music <a href="./theory/">Theory</a> study, that helps beginners learn complex music concepts in color. Interactive web-apps in the <a href="./practice/">Practice</a> section expand the knowledge and grow deeper music awareness. Those, who want to go beyond personal explorations and get guided educational programs and community learning experience, can become members of Chromatone <a href="/academy/">Academy</a>. And we are just getting started! Also for those, who want to touch and feel the colorful notes we have a cozy <a href="./shop/">Sticker Shop</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions or ideas to share - feel free to <a href="./contacts/">contact us</a> today.</p>',6),i=[r];function c(p,l,h,d,m,u){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const _=e(s,[["render",c]]);export{g as __pageData,_ as default};
