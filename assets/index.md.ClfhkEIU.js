It&#39;s evolving through further merging colors with notes, rhythms with shapes, intervals with gradients, chords and scales with palettes. And we pave the way for new generations of visual music explorers.</p><p>We&#39;re creating the Visual Music <a href="./theory/">Theory</a> study, that helps beginners learn complex music concepts in color. Interactive web-apps in the <a href="./practice/">Practice</a> section expand the knowledge and grow deeper music awareness. Those, who want to go beyond personal explorations and get guided educational programs and community learning experience, can become members of Chromatone <a href="/academy/">Academy</a>.
