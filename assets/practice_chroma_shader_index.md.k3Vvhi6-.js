Incorporating a microphone to capture live ambient audio, the installation analyzes the sounds and assigns one of twelve unique colors to each of the twelve distinct pitch classes, effectively rendering a visual representation of the sound's frequency content on a screen. This innovative approach not only allows for the visualization of music but also creates a multisensory feedback loop, engaging both sight and hearing in a unified perceptual experience.",-1),d=t("p",null,"The artwork operates within the broader context of the Chromatone music web-apps ecosystem, which is designed to facilitate the study and appreciation of music through visual means.
