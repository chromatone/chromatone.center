My name is Denis and I&#39;m the author and developer of Chromatone - the Visual Music Language online research hub. I&#39;m building it as an open source web-app from 2017 here <a href="https://chromatone.center/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://chromatone.center/</a> . It was a move from limitations of Wordpress to freedom of creativity with Vue, Vite, Vitepress, Tone.js, Elementary.js and, of course, WebMIDI.js. Now we&#39;re at 2.9.x version and approaching 3.0. I started with WebMIDI even before</p>',6)]))}const c=t(s,[["render",i]]);export{b as __pageData,c as default};
