And also there&#39;s the exact frequency in Hz.</li><li>Next tap the note rectangles to turn the sound on. The bottom row holds the root note in 3 lower octaves to create a deep base for the sound. The top row consists of three pads of the higher fifth intervals of that base frequency.</li><li>Drag each of the pads up and down to set the maximum level of that note. Each note has a random speed LFO, that is modulating its volume from 0 to this upper limit. Reload the page to get a new LFO speed composition.</li><li>Drag each pad horizontally to set the middle point for the slow;y moving panning of the voice.</li><li>Listen to the tone to evolve and breathe with harmonics. Try singing to it, tuning your instruments or just feeling the vibrations.</li><li>If it&#39;s too much of the high frequency content you can adjust it with the <strong>LP</strong> slider – it sets the frequency of the drone Low-pass filter.</li><li>Press <strong>stop</strong> button to mute the voices and press <strong>play</strong> to unmute them back.
