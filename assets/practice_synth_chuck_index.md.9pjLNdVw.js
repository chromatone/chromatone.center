ChucK offers a unique <strong>time-based, concurrent programming model</strong> that is precise and expressive (we call this <strong>strongly-timed</strong>), dynamic control rates, and the ability to add and modify code <strong>on-the-fly</strong>. In addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OpenSoundControl, HID device, and multi-channel audio. It is open-source and freely available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It&#39;s fun and easy to learn, and offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio synthesis/analysis programs, and real-time interactive music.</p><h3 id="links" tabindex="-1">Links <a class="header-anchor" href="#links" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Links&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://chuck.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://chuck.stanford.edu/</a></li><li><a href="https://chuck.stanford.edu/ide/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://chuck.stanford.edu/ide/#</a></li><li><a href="https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/examples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/examples/</a></li><li><a href="https://artful.design/stuff/samples/chuck.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://artful.design/stuff/samples/chuck.pdf</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/ccrma/webchuck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/ccrma/webchuck</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/ccrma/webchuck/blob/main/docs/classes/Chuck.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/ccrma/webchuck/blob/main/docs/classes/Chuck.md</a></li></ul>',3),v=JSON.parse('{"title":"ChucK","description":"Music programming language","frontmatter":{"title":"ChucK","description":"Music programming language","date":"2022-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","cover":"ch.png","layout":"app"},"headers":[],"relativePath":"practice/synth/chuck/index.md","filePath":"practice/synth/chuck/index.md","lastUpdated":1704219385000}'),g={name:"practice/synth/chuck/index.md"},T=Object.assign(g,{setup(k){const a=h(()=>m(()=>import("./chunks/SynthChuck.0Ffboalw.js"),__vite__mapDeps([0,1])));return(b,y)=>{const r=l("client-only"),n=p;return d(),o("div",null,[f,e(r,null,{default:s(()=>[e(u(a))]),_:1}),_,e(n,{video:"2rpk461T6l4"})])}}});export{v as __pageData,T as default};
