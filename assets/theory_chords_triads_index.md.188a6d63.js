The lack of a minor or a major third in the chord creates an open sound, while the dissonance between the fourth and fifth or second and root creates tension. When using popular-music symbols, they are indicated by the symbols &quot;sus4&quot; and &quot;sus2&quot;.</p><p>The term is borrowed from the contrapuntal technique of suspension, where a note from a previous chord is carried over to the next chord, and then resolved down to the third or tonic, suspending a note from the previous chord. However, in modern usage, the term concerns only the notes played at a given time; in a suspended chord, the added tone does not necessarily resolve and is not necessarily &quot;prepared&quot; (i.e., held over) from the prior chord. As such, in C–F–G, F would resolve to E (or E♭, in the case of C minor), but in rock and popular music, &quot;the term is used to indicate only the harmonic structure, with no implications about what comes before or after,&quot; though preparation of the fourth occurs about half the time and traditional resolution of the fourth occurs usually. In modern jazz, a third can be added to the chord voicing, as long as it is above the fourth.</p><p>Each suspended chord has two inversions. Suspended second chords are inversions of suspended fourth chords, and vice versa. For example, Gsus2 (G–A–D) is the first inversion of Dsus4 (D–G–A) which is the second inversion of Gsus2 (G–A–D). The sus2 and sus4 chords both have an inversion that creates a quartal chord (A–D–G) with two stacked perfect fourths.</p><p>Sevenths on suspended chords are &quot;virtually always minor sevenths&quot;, while the 9sus4 chord is similar to an eleventh chord and may be notated as such. For example, C9sus4 (C–F–G–B♭–D) may be notated C11 (C–G–B♭–D–F).</p>',10),p=e("hr",null,null,-1),f=e("h2",{id:"augmented-and-diminished",tabindex:"-1"},[s("Augmented and diminished "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#augmented-and-diminished","aria-label":'Permalink to "Augmented and diminished"'},"​")],-1),b=e("p",null,'A diminished triad (also known as the minor flatted fifth) is a triad consisting of two minor thirds above the root.
