As illustrated, in the RYB color model, red, yellow, and blue are intermixed to create secondary color segments of orange, green, and purple. This set of primary colors emerged at a time when access to a large range of pigments was limited by availability and cost, and it encouraged artists and designers to explore the many nuances of color through mixing and intermixing a limited range of pigment colors. In art and design education, red, yellow, and blue pigments were usually augmented with white and black pigments, enabling the creation of a larger gamut of color nuances including tints and shades.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><blockquote><p><strong>Jacob Christoph Le Blon</strong> was the first to apply the RYB color model to printing, specifically mezzotint printing, and he used separate plates for each color: yellow, red and blue plus black to add shades and contrast. In &#39;Coloritto&#39;, Le Blon asserted that “the art of mixing colours…(in) painting can represent all visible objects with three colours: yellow, red and blue; for all colours can be composed of these three, which I call Primitive”. Le Blon added that red and yellow make orange; red and blue, make purple; and blue and yellow make green (Le Blon, 1725, p6).</p></blockquote><h3 id="cmy-and-cmyk" tabindex="-1">CMY and CMYK <a class="header-anchor" href="#cmy-and-cmyk" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;CMY and CMYK&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The <strong>CMY</strong> color model is a subtractive color model in which cyan, magenta and yellow pigments or dyes are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.</p><p>When the intensities for all the components are the same, the result is a shade of gray, lighter, or darker depending on the intensity.
