Light, containing all spectral colors is perceived white. Color of an object depends on the range of wavelengths of light that are absorbed or reflected by its surface. The sense of a particular color is produced in nervous system by combining signal from three types of cones, sensitive to red, green and blue ranges of the spectrum.</p><img src="'+i+'"><img src="'+n+'"><img src="'+r+'"><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>The human eye with normal vision has three kinds of cone cells that sense light, having peaks of spectral sensitivity in short (&quot;S&quot;, 420 nm – 440 nm), middle (&quot;M&quot;, 530 nm – 540 nm), and long (&quot;L&quot;, 560 nm – 580 nm) wavelengths. These cone cells underlie human color perception in conditions of medium and high brightness; in very dim light color vision diminishes, and the low-brightness, monochromatic &quot;night vision&quot; receptors, denominated &quot;rod cells&quot;, become effective. Thus, three parameters corresponding to levels of stimulus of the three kinds of cone cells, in principle describe any human color sensation. Weighting a total light power spectrum by the individual spectral sensitivities of the three kinds of cone cells renders three effective values of stimulus; these three values compose a tristimulus specification of the objective color of the light spectrum. The three parameters, denoted &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;, are indicated using a 3-dimensional space denominated the &quot;LMS color space&quot;, which is one of many color spaces devised to quantify human color vision.</p><img src="'+c+'"><img src="'+l+'"><blockquote><img src="'+h+'"><p>The CIE XYZ standard observer color matching functions</p></blockquote><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="opposite-color-vision-theory" tabindex="-1">Opposite color vision theory <a class="header-anchor" href="#opposite-color-vision-theory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Opposite color vision theory&quot;">​</a></h2><img src="'+u+'"><h2 id="just-noticable-difference" tabindex="-1">Just noticable difference <a class="header-anchor" href="#just-noticable-difference" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Just noticable difference&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Tolerancing concerns the question &quot;What is a set of colors that are imperceptibly/acceptably close to a given reference?&quot; If the distance measure is perceptually uniform, then the answer is simply &quot;the set of points whose distance to the reference is less than the just-noticeable-difference (JND) threshold.&quot; This requires a perceptually uniform metric in order for the threshold to be constant throughout the gamut (range of colors). Otherwise, the threshold will be a function of the reference color—cumbersome as a practical guide.</p><p>In the CIE 1931 color space, for example, the tolerance contours are defined by the MacAdam ellipse, which holds L* (lightness) fixed. As can be observed on the adjacent diagram, the ellipses denoting the tolerance contours vary in size. It is partly this non-uniformity that led to the creation of CIELUV and CIELAB.</p><blockquote><p><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p><p>A MacAdam diagram in the CIE 1931 color space.
