Each of these systems is expressed in a strict hierarchical structure where dominant regions contain smaller subordinate elements and equal elements exist contiguously within a particular and explicit hierarchical level. In GTTM any level can be small-scale or large-scale depending on the size of its elements.</p><h3 id="structures" tabindex="-1">Structures <a class="header-anchor" href="#structures" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structures&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="i-grouping-structure" tabindex="-1">I. Grouping structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#i-grouping-structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;I. Grouping structure&quot;">​</a></h4><p>GTTM considers grouping analysis to be the most basic component of musical understanding.

Metrical structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#ii-metrical-structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;II. Metrical structure&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Metrical structure expresses the intuition that the events of a piece are related to a regular alternation of strong and weak beats at a number of hierarchical levels. It is a crucial basis for all the structures and reductions of GTTM.</p><h3 id="iii-time-span-reduction" tabindex="-1">III. Time-span reduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#iii-time-span-reduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;III. Time-span reduction&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Time-span reductions (TSRs) are based on information gleaned from metrical and grouping structures. They establish tree structure-style hierarchical organizations uniting time-spans at all temporal levels of a work. The TSR analysis begins at the smallest levels, where metrical structure marks off the music into beats of equal length (or more precisely into attack points separated by uniform time-spans) and moves through all larger levels where grouping structure divides the music into motives, phrases, periods, theme groups, and still greater divisions. It further specifies a “head” (or most structurally important event) for each time-span at all hierarchical levels of the analysis. A completed TSR analysis is often called a time-span tree.</p><h3 id="iv-prolongational-reduction" tabindex="-1">IV. Prolongational reduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#iv-prolongational-reduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;IV. Prolongational reduction&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Prolongational reduction (PR) provides our &quot;psychological&quot; awareness of tensing and relaxing patterns in a given piece with precise structural terms. In time-span reduction, the hierarchy of less and more important events is established according to rhythmic stability. In prolongational reduction, hierarchy is concerned with relative stability expressed in terms of continuity and progression, the movement toward tension or relaxation, and the degree of closure or non-closure. A PR analysis also produces a tree-structure style hierarchical analysis, but this information is often conveyed in a visually condensed modified &quot;slur&quot; notation.</p><p>The need for prolongational reduction mainly arises from two limitations of time-span reductions. The first is that time-span reduction fails to express the sense of continuity produced by harmonic rhythm. The second is that time-span reduction—even though it establishes that particular pitch-events are heard in relation to a particular beat, within a particular group—fails to say anything about how music flows across these segments.</p><h3 id="more-on-tsr-vs-pr" tabindex="-1">More on TSR vs PR <a class="header-anchor" href="#more-on-tsr-vs-pr" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;More on TSR vs PR&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It is helpful to note some basic differences between a time-span tree produced by TSR and a prolongational tree produced by PR. First, though the basic branching divisions produced by the two trees are often the same or similar at high structural levels, branching variations between the two trees often occur as one travels further down towards the musical surface.</p><p>A second and equally important differentiation is that a prolongational tree carries three types of branching: strong prolongation (represented by an open node at the branching point), weak prolongation (a filled node at the branching point) and progression (simple branching, with no node). Time-span trees do not make this distinction. All time-span tree branches are simple branches without nodes (though time-span tree branches are often annotated with other helpful comments).</p>',15)),o(r,{video:"qWreUHbws9g"}),e[4]||(e[4]=i('<h2 id="rules" tabindex="-1">Rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#rules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rules&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Each of the four major hierarchical organizations (grouping structure, metrical structure, time-span reduction and prolongational reduction) is established through rules, which are in three categories:</p><ol><li>The well-formedness rules, which specify possible structural descriptions.</li><li>The preference rules, which draw on possible structural descriptions eliciting those descriptions that correspond to experienced listeners’ hearings of any particular piece.</li><li>The transformational rules, which provide a means of associating distorted structures with well-formed descriptions.</li></ol><h3 id="i-grouping-structure-rules" tabindex="-1">I.
