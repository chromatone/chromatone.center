Thus a passage in common time with a stream of sixteenth notes and chord changes every measure has a slow harmonic rhythm and a fast surface or &quot;musical&quot; rhythm (16 notes per chord change), while a piece with a trickle of half notes and chord changes twice a measure has a fast harmonic rhythm and a slow surface rhythm (1 note per chord change). Harmonic rhythm may be described as strong or weak.</p><p>According to William Russo harmonic rhythm is, &quot;the duration of each different chord...in a succession of chords.&quot; According to Joseph Swain (2002 p. 4) harmonic rhythm, &quot;is simply that perception of rhythm that depends on changes in aspects of harmony.&quot; According to Walter Piston (1944), &quot;the rhythmic life contributed to music by means of the underlying changes of harmony. The pattern of the harmonic rhythm of a given piece of music, derived by noting the root changes as they occur, reveals important and distinctive features affecting the style and texture.&quot;</p><p>Strong harmonic rhythm is characterized by strong root progressions and emphasis of root positions, weak contrapuntal bass motion, strong rhythmic placement in the measure (especially downbeat), and relatively longer duration.</p><p>&quot;The &#39;fastness&#39; or &#39;slowness&#39; of harmonic rhythm is not absolute, but relative,&quot;[self-published source] and thus analysts compare the overall pace of harmonic rhythm from one piece to another, or the amount of variation of harmonic rhythm within a piece. For example, a key stylistic difference between Baroque music and Classical-period music is that the latter exhibits much more variety of harmonic rhythm, even though the harmony itself is less complex.</p>',7)]))}const y=o(n,[["render",h]]);export{p as __pageData,y as default};
