For instance, a three-note quintal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fifths, C–G–D.</p><h2 id="properties" tabindex="-1">Properties <a class="header-anchor" href="#properties" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Properties&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The terms quartal and quintal imply a contrast, either compositional or perceptual, with traditional harmonic constructions based on thirds: listeners familiar with music of the common practice period are guided by tonalities constructed with familiar elements: the chords that make up major and minor scales, all in turn built from major and minor thirds.</p><p>Regarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer Vincent Persichetti writes that:</p><blockquote><p>Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals (diminished seventh chords or augmented triads), any member can function as the root. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of key verification upon the voice with the most active melodic line.</p></blockquote><p>Quintal harmony (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the inversion or complement of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from quartal harmony. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.</p><p>Like tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different voicings, some of which obscure its quartal structure.</p><h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History <a class="header-anchor" href="#history" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;History&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the Middle Ages, simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance. During the common practice period (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a dissonance (when appearing as a suspension requiring resolution in the voice leading) or as a consonance (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord). In the later 19th century, during the breakdown of tonality in classical music, all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed. Quartal harmony was developed in the early 20th century as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.</p><h2 id="precursors" tabindex="-1">Precursors <a class="header-anchor" href="#precursors" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Precursors&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Tristan chord is made up of the notes F♮, B♮, D♯ and G♯ and is the first chord heard in Wagner&#39;s opera Tristan und Isolde.</p><p>The bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant. The chord had been found in earlier works, notably Beethoven&#39;s Piano Sonata No. 18, but Wagner&#39;s use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional tonal harmony and even towards atonality, and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its function, a notion which was soon after to be explored by Debussy and others.</p><p>Despite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as &quot;quartal harmony&quot; or even as &quot;proto-quartal harmony&quot;, since Wagner&#39;s musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary dominant seventh chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F–B–D–G). Wagner&#39;s unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.</p><p>At the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. Scriabin used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his Mystic chord (shown below) in his Piano Sonata No. 6.</p><p>Scriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional tertian passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C–F♯–B♭–E–A–D) into a seven-note chord (C–F♯–B♭–E–A–D–G). Scriabin&#39;s sketches for his unfinished work Mysterium show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the chromatic scale.</p><p>In France, Erik Satie experimented with planing in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for Le Fils des étoiles. Paul Dukas&#39;s The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to &quot;rise and rise&quot;.</p>',17)),i(t,{video:"DlML3adH9yQ"}),e[1]||(e[1]=o('<h2 id="_20th-and-21st-century-classical-music" tabindex="-1">20th- and 21st-century classical music <a class="header-anchor" href="#_20th-and-21st-century-classical-music" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;20th- and 21st-century classical music&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Composers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include Claude Debussy, Francis Poulenc, Alexander Scriabin, Alban Berg, Leonard Bernstein, Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Joe Hisaishi and Anton Webern.[7]</p><h3 id="schoenberg" tabindex="-1">Schoenberg <a class="header-anchor" href="#schoenberg" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Schoenberg&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Arnold Schoenberg&#39;s Chamber Symphony Op. 9 (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measure and a half construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes (highlighted in red in the illustration) A–D♯–F–B♭–E♭–A♭ distributed over the five stringed instruments (the viola must tune down the lowest string by a minor third, and read in the unfamiliar tenor clef).</p><p>The composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).</p><p>Schoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his Theory of Harmony (Harmonielehre) of 1911, he wrote:</p><blockquote><p>The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the chromatic scale; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords… But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony.</p></blockquote><p>For Anton Webern, the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds.

In his 1937 writing Unterweisung im Tonsatz (The Craft of Musical Composition,Hindemith 1937) he wrote that &quot;notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,&quot; so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition &quot;...the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.&quot; He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. &quot;The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its Combination tones.&quot;</p><p>The works of the Filipino composer Eliseo M.
