Tonality is a system of harmony created &amp; used in the Common-Practice Period (that is, in the Baroque, Classical and Romantic Eras of classical music), so from about 1700 to 1900. Tonal harmony is the ‘standard’ music theory that you learn through your Classical music studies. And, in fact, most of my previous lessons presuppose or function within ‘tonal harmony’.</p><p>Tonality has the following features:</p><ul><li>It uses Major and minor keys</li><li>It uses a Functional Harmony</li><li>It has a Tonal Centre (i.e. root note)</li></ul><p>So point one is self-explanatory. Points two and three are more interesting. Tonality uses a Functional Harmony and has a Tonal Centre (that is, a Tonic). In tonal harmony every chord has a function, it can be categorised as either:</p><ul><li>Pre-Dominant;</li><li>Dominant; or</li><li>Tonic</li></ul><p>The function of a Pre-Dominant chord is to get you to the Dominant chord. The function of a Dominant chord is to get you to the Tonic chord, thus the harmony (that is, the chords) are ‘functional’.</p><p>And the Tonic chord is the ‘Tonal Centre’. This can be thought of as a ‘Centre of Gravity’ to which all other chords gravitate and resolved into.</p><p>Thus, a tonal chord progression sounds like it is moving towards the tonic. For example, take the below chord progression:</p><p>Em7 A7 Dm7 G7 ???</p><h2 id="what-chord-comes-next" tabindex="-1">What chord comes next? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-chord-comes-next" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What chord comes next?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We all know instinctively that it should be a CMaj7. It just SOUNDS like it needs to go back home and resolve to the tonic; thus there is a ‘tonal centre’. (Notice also that tonal chord progressions tend to move via the Circle of Fifths).</p><p>The G7 gravitates and wants to resolve to CMaj7. This is because all Dominant chords have a tritone interval between their 3rd and 7th (in the case of G7 – B &amp; F). This is known as a ‘diatonic tritone‘. The tritone is a very unstable and dissonant interval that wants to resolve. And it does so either:</p><ul><li>Inwards to C &amp; E (1 &amp; 3 of CMaj7 – creating a G7 to CMaj7 progression)</li><li>Outwards to B♭ &amp; G♭ (3 &amp; 1 of G♭Maj7 – creating a D♭7 to G♭Maj7 progression)</li></ul><p>This ‘diatonic tritone’ is the basis of all tonal music. It is what makes the Dominant chord feel like it wants to resolve to the tonic (thus making the music ‘tonal’).</p><h2 id="functional-tonal-harmony-1" tabindex="-1">Functional Tonal Harmony 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#functional-tonal-harmony-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Functional Tonal Harmony 1&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Part one of three.
