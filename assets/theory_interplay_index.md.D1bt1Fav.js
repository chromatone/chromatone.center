Together they form Chromatone – the colorful notation system. It&#39;s based on combining the two circular models – the octave equivalence in music and the color circle of visual arts. This gives not only the colors for each of 12 chromatic notes of modern music, but can be extended to derive a certain color for any acoustic frequency.</p><h1 id="circle-of-colors-and-notes" tabindex="-1">Circle of colors and notes <a class="header-anchor" href="#circle-of-colors-and-notes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Circle of colors and notes&quot;">​</a></h1><img src="'+r+'"><p>A is the lowest frequency note and red is the lowest frequency color.
