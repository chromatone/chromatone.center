Most historical commentary on visual music finds an origin point in the Medieval color organ, which is the earliest known technological precursor to today’s iTunes Visualizer. Many commentators, however, do not go so far back, and relate visual music to early 20th Century trends in Modernism. In today’s maker culture, there is often a lack of deep historical sense and context. At the start of the first video embed below, an Arduino-tinkerer claims that the color organ originated in the 1970s (!) when there was a genre of music-light interactive consumer novelties that were also called color organs.

In the 1960s and ’70s, the term “color organ” became popularly associated with electronic devices that responded to their music inputs with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_light_show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">light shows</a>.

Its antecedents are in Wagner’s Gesamtkunstwerk (indeed, Richard Wagner’s “Evening Star” is the music of Mary Ellen Bute’s Synchrony №2) or total artwork (a fusion of the all the arts and consequently, of the senses), but it also has roots in the Symbolist and Spiritualist movements of the 19th century — all of this has its origins in Schopenhauer’s philosophy of music, in which music was framed as the highest art due to its ability to directly represent the Will (for Schopenhauer, the Will as a category included magnetism, love, rage, and electricity — in other words, forces in general, whether internal to one’s self and unconscious, or external in the workings of the world).</p><blockquote><p>As an outgrowth of the Romantic and Symbolist movements, music was elevated to a status of supremacy over all the other forms of creative expression. The other arts, notably poetry and painting, were said to aspire to the “condition of music.” Artists came to believe that painting should be analogous to music.</p><p>Proponents of musical analogy based their aesthetic theories on an abstraction of the idea of music, rather than on a clear understanding of musicology. For them music represented a non-narrative, non-discursive mode of expression. They reasoned that music, in its direct appeal to emotions and senses, transcended language. Just as music was a universal form of expression, so should the visual arts attain universality by evoking sensual pleasure or an emotional response in the viewer.</p><p>Advocates of musical analogy and color music also depended upon the related notion of synaesthesia; that is, they believed in the subjective interaction of all sensory perceptions. This common acceptance of synaesthesia resulted from two divergent philosophical positions. According to the more romantically inclined artists and writers, the interchangeability of the senses was evidence of mystical correspondence to a higher reality. On the other hand, some artists joined forces with scientific researchers to study synaesthesia as a phenomenon of human perception. (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1483303?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Many works in the filmic synaesthetic tradition can be read as an a counter-modernist inclination, a vestige of romantic impulse in the development of 20th century mediation.</p><h2 id="sound-design" tabindex="-1"><strong>Sound Design</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#sound-design" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Sound Design**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The term Sound Design came into vogue in the 1970s to describe a new role in the creation of the sound film, analogous to a “director” or “cinematographer” of the soundtrack. In the early ’70s Dolby noise reduction, which had already established itself widely in music production and distribution during the ’60s, expanded its application to the area of film sound. The specific properties of Dolby — increased dynamic range, improved spatialization, better frequency response, and reduction of the noise floor — combined with Dolby’s strategy of providing relatively affordable licensing to theater owners so that it’s noise reduction technology could be widely adapted, provided for the first time a universal standard in cinematic sound reproduction, allowing the sound mix heard in the theaters to be closer to that heard on the mix stage than at any time previously. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dolby-era-contemporary-Hollywood-Popular/dp/0719070678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source</a>)</p><p>The aesthetic possibilities opened up by this technological change were exploited by filmmakers, particularly those based in San Francisco’s “Hollywood North.” For instance, the two artist-technicians usually credited with being the first “sound designers” (the first to receive this designation), Ben Burtt and Walter Murch, were each given unprecedented periods of time to explore sound as a dimension of film. Burtt was given more than a year to build a sound effects library for George Lucas’s <em>Star Wars</em> film soundtrack, famously (in widely circulated images) “wandering the desert” with field recording gear, tapping on phone wires and recording sounds that would eventually support such futuristic technologies as X-Wing Fighters and light sabers. Murch spent a year mixing and remixing Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, trying out multiple edits and approaches to what is likewise (as in the case of Star Wars) regarded as a paradigm shift in film mixing.</p><p>In entertainment industry contexts, sound‘s role is often described in the relevant literature as a form of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Music-Imagination-Culture-Clarendon-Paperbacks/dp/0198163037/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Music%2C+Imagination+and+Culture+by+Nicholas+Cook&amp;qid=1579364384&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">subordination</a>” to the film’s imagery. In other words, the work of the soundtrack is to reinforce, through its specific effects (heightened emotion, spatial depth, representing sound sources, clarity of speech, rhythmic pacing and the like) the narratological and often “realist” motivations of the image track (and reciprocally, reserving “weird sound.” often simply taken from the realm of avant-garde music — for dream sequences, aliens, monsters and the like (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005s0z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source</a>). Such an approach is typical of more narrative, mainstream or commercial projects.</p><p>In contrast, experimental approaches to sound design tend to assert a relative autonomy for the soundtrack in relation to the moving image. But at the same time there is often an “associational intent” at work, in that there is an attempt to create poetic or connotational relationships between sound and image.</p><h2 id="experimental-music" tabindex="-1"><strong>Experimental Music</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#experimental-music" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Experimental Music**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In her paper “Experimental Music Semiotics,” Morag Josephine Grant elaborates an intriguing <a href="https://vanseodesign.com/web-design/icon-index-symbol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Peircean semiotic approach</a> to understanding the distinction between experimental music and other forms of avant-garde, classical or “new” music.

For instance, an interval can be read as also referring to a moment in the score, a minor third, and all the rules of harmony with its allowances and strictures of what one is to do with a minor third (or not do with it). In the recapitulation of a theme, the work itself can be understood as the interpretant which contextualizes its significance. One can expand this to other fields of music as well. Jazz, for instance, can be understood as a metaphor or symbol for communication (call and response, dialogue). To draw her distinction sharply, she offers the striking example of the sound of a telephone:</p><blockquote><p>So why don’t telephones ring in music? They ring all over the place in literature. They appear in pictures more often than they do in music. They are the hinge of countless film plots.</p><p>The case of experimental music is immediately different because it can deal with the telephone as a telephone.</p></blockquote><p>Grant cites <a href="https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783476012265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Winfried Nöth</a>, noting that “the index makes no assertions regarding its object, but merely shows us the object or draws our attention to it,” the index is “of fact, of reality, and of experience in time and space.”</p><p>Experimental music does not draw a distinction between the realms of “music” and that of “sound and noise.” It forces our attention to the causal dimensions of sonic experience, the productions of sonorous bodies, rather than to the systemic embeddedness of a sound in a formal logic or system (such as score, or the rules of harmony). Indeed, to further bolster her argument that non-experimental (but still scored) music has more of a symbolic character, we need only note the aspects of rhetoric that accompany such compositions: themes, argument, development, recapitulation, verse, refrain, and the like.</p><p>Grant does not assert, however, that non-experimental music is only symbolic, or that experimental music is only indexical. Indeed, her essay devotes much time to exploring devil’s advocate, borderline, and seemingly contradictory examples to her schema. She notes that “signification generally involves complex hybrids of these categories (icon, index, symbol).” But as a general description of what may make some music “experimental” and others not, it does have a subtle cogency. For instance, John Cage’s silent work <em>4’33”</em> can be understood in relation to Peirce’s example of the indexical weather vane signifying even the absence of wind.</p><blockquote><p>Even if there is no wind at a particular moment, the weather vane still fulfills its purpose, confirming that there is no wind… It is specifically created to draw our attention to something by contiguous relationship with it. Even if there is never wind again, a weather vane will not stop being a weather vane…</p></blockquote><p>The silence evoked by Cage in this work is analogous to the absence of wind — it is still significant (hence a work of experimental music) even though it does not sound.</p><p>What is interesting to note about visualized sound in a Peircean semiotic context is that the sound which results from such processes has its “origin” in an indexical (directly causal) relationship. The nature of the index-causality is different in these cases: pen or scratches on film emulsion in McLaren’s work, or digital drawing tablet in the case of Xenakis‘ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPIC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UPIC system</a>. However, once we as listener-viewers are experiencing the work, the synaesthetic play of visual-sonic percepts takes on an iconic dimension as well, as we start to see that the sounds high up in the visual frame also sound high-pitched, or thick bands may produce clusters, while thin bands produce purer tones, or as we notice the way in which rhythmic syncretism in sound and image reinforce each other. At times one feels that one is really ‘seeing the sound’ but simultaneously sounds and images have their own autonomy — in fact, in an iconic sense one is only seeing certain aspects of the sound — both the visual and sonic imagination have their own resonances which can’t be entirely merged.</p><h2 id="new-visualizations-in-music" tabindex="-1">New Visualizations in Music <a class="header-anchor" href="#new-visualizations-in-music" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;New Visualizations in Music&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the context of visual music, we would be amiss if we didn’t touch on new practices of visualizing musical form that have gone far beyond traditional music notation using bass and treble clefs, note and rest values, bars, measures, time signatures, and all of the other inscription apparatus of classical music common practice. As musical form exploded in its sheer variety of approaches in the 20th Century, so too did ways of representing the new kinds of sounds and their composition.
