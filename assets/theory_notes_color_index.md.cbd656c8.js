It may sound too much to use numbers for the actual notes, but it happens to be a nice way to make music even more easy to study. In any case nowadays music is stored in some kind of digital format. May be if we add colors to our music notation we can add the numbers without any confusion? So any properly colored number will have a distinct frequency to play (in 12-TET or beyond)?</p><img src="'+r+'"><h2 id="colorful-piano-rolls" tabindex="-1">Colorful piano rolls <a class="header-anchor" href="#colorful-piano-rolls" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Colorful piano rolls&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Try the <a href="./../../../practice/midi/roll/">MIDI-roll</a> to look at incoming MIDI visualization.</p><p>Try the <a href="./../../../practice/pitch/roll/">Pitch-roll</a> to see the main note graph of incoming audio on an endless roll.</p><h2 id="colorful-spectrogram" tabindex="-1">Colorful spectrogram <a class="header-anchor" href="#colorful-spectrogram" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Colorful spectrogram&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Adding the colors to a regular spectrogram makes you see much more about the musical contents of any sound.
