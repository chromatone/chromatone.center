If the song is sung a tone higher it is still perceived to be the same song, and the notes have the same relationship to each other, but in a fixed Do all the note names would be different. A movable Do emphasizes the musicality of the tune as the psychological perception of the notes is always relative to a key for the vast majority of people that do not have absolute pitch.</p><p>Jose Sotorrio argues that fixed-do is preferable for serious musicians, as music involving complex modulations and vague tonality is often too ambiguous with regard to key for any movable system. That is, without a prior analysis of the music, any movable-do system would inevitably need to be used like a fixed-do system anyway, thus causing confusion. With fixed-do, the musician learns to regard any syllable as the tonic, which does not force them to make an analysis as to which note is the tonic when ambiguity occurs. Instead, with fixed-do the musician will already be practiced in thinking in multiple/undetermined tonalities using the corresponding syllables.</p><p>In comparison to the movable do system, which draws on short-term relative pitch skills involving comparison to a pitch identified as the tonic of the particular piece being performed, fixed do develops long-term relative pitch skills involving comparison to a pitch defined independently of its role in the piece, a practice closer to the definition of each note in absolute terms as found in absolute pitch.</p><p>Instrumentalists who begin sight-singing for the first time in college as music majors find movable do to be the system more consistent with the way they learned to read music.</p><p>For choirs, sight-singing fixed do using chromatic movable do syllables is more suitable than sight-singing movable do for reading atonal music, polytonal music, pandiatonic music, music that modulates or changes key often, or music in which the composer simply did not write a key signature. It is not uncommon for this to be the case in modern or contemporary choral works.</p><h2 id="tonic-sol-fa-notation" tabindex="-1">Tonic sol-fa notation <a class="header-anchor" href="#tonic-sol-fa-notation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tonic sol-fa notation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Curwen&#39;s system, the notes of the major scale (of any key) are notated with the single letters d, r, m, f, s, l, and t. For notes above the principal octave, an apostrophe follows the letter; notes below the principal octave have a subscript mark. Chromatic alterations are marked by the following vowel, &quot;e&quot; for sharp (pronounced &quot;ee&quot;) and &quot;a&quot; for flat (pronounced &quot;aw&quot;). Thus, the ascending and descending chromatic scale is notated:</p><blockquote><p>d de r re m f fe s se l le t d&#39;</p><p>d&#39; t ta l la s sa f m ma r ra d</p></blockquote><p>Such chromatic notes appear only as ornaments or as preparation for a modulation; once the music has modulated, then the names for the new key are used. The modulation itself is marked by superscript of the old note name preceding its new name; for example, in modulation to the dominant, the new tonic is notated as sd. The music then proceeds in the new key until another modulation is notated.</p><h2 id="arabic-system" tabindex="-1">Arabic system <a class="header-anchor" href="#arabic-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Arabic system&quot;">​</a></h2><p>An alternative theory argues that the solfège syllables (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti) derive from the syllables of an Arabic solmization system درر مفصّلات Durar Mufaṣṣalāt (&quot;Detailed Pearls&quot;) (<strong>dāl, rā&#39;, mīm, fā&#39;, ṣād, lām, tā</strong>), mentioned in the works of Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski in 1680 and later discussed by Jean-Benjamin de La Borde in 1780. However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory.</p><h2 id="indian-sargam" tabindex="-1">Indian sargam <a class="header-anchor" href="#indian-sargam" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Indian sargam&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Svara solmization of India has origins in Vedic texts like the Upanishads, which discuss a musical system of seven notes, realized ultimately in what is known as sargam. In Indian classical music, the notes in order are: <strong>sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni</strong>, which correspond to the Western solfege system.</p><p>These seven degrees are shared by both major rāga system, that is the North Indian (Hindustani) and South Indian (Carnatic). The solfege (sargam) is learnt in abbreviated form: sa, ri (Carnatic) or re (Hindustani), ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, sa. Of these, the first that is &quot;sa&quot;, and the fifth that is &quot;pa&quot;, are considered anchors that are unalterable, while the remaining have flavors that differs between the two major systems.</p><h2 id="byzantine-system" tabindex="-1">Byzantine system <a class="header-anchor" href="#byzantine-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Byzantine system&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Byzantine music uses syllables derived from the Greek alphabet to name notes: starting with A, the notes are <strong>pa (alpha), vu (beta, pronounced v in modern greek), ga (gamma), di (delta), ke (epsilon), zo (zeta), ni (eta)</strong>.</p><h2 id="asian-systems" tabindex="-1">Asian systems <a class="header-anchor" href="#asian-systems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Asian systems&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For Han people&#39;s music in China, the words used to name notes are (from fa to mi): <strong>上 (siong or shàng), 尺 (cei or chǐ), 工 (gōng), 凡 (huan or fán), 六 (liuo or liù), 五 (ngou or wǔ), 乙 (yik or yǐ)</strong>. The system is used for teaching sight-singing.</p><p>For Japanese music, the first line of Iroha, an ancient poem used as a tutorial of traditional kana, is used for solmization. The syllables representing the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, G are <strong>i, ro, ha, ni, ho, he, to</strong> respectively. Shakuhachi musical notation uses another solmization system beginning &quot;Fu Ho U&quot;.</p><p>Javanese musicians derive syllables from numbers: <strong>ji-ro-lu-pat-ma-nem-pi</strong>. These names derive from one-syllable simplification of the Javanese numerals siji, loro, telu, papat, lima, enem, pitu. ([Pa]pat and pi[tu], corresponding to 4 and 7, are skipped in the pentatonic slendro scale.)</p><h2 id="dodeka-system" tabindex="-1">DODEKA system <a class="header-anchor" href="#dodeka-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;DODEKA system&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The objective was to create 2-letter names that convey a relationship between the names of the notes and their position on the staff.</p><p>We did that using letters that are not present in the English (anglo-saxon) designation.</p><p>For example, the note Do# (C#) is called Ka (K) because it shares the same position as La (A) (ie. both notes are above a line).</p><p>Following this logic, the 12 notes can be written as: Do / Ka / Ré / To(l) / Mi / Fa / Hu / So(l) / Pi / La / Vé / Si.</p><p>In English, we only use the first letters, which gives us the following sequence: C / K / D / T / E / F / H / G / P / A / V / B.</p>',27)]))}const u=t(i,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,u as default};
