From the basic components of a synth and different types of synthesis to synthesising all kinds of instruments whether it’s strings, brass, wind instruments or various percussive sounds. This tutorial series is certainly the most extensive of its kind on synthesis. Even for producers and musicians who are well acquainted with synthesis, there is something new to learn or knowledge to freshen up. All of the tutorials are still accessible, even if not directly via the magazine’s website. You can find them all listed below in chronological order.","cover":"a58ad86f-10b6-4557-92c3-727065953661","type":"resource"},{"id":31,"status":"published","url":"https://programmingdesignsystems.com/","title":"A free digital book that teaches a practical introduction to the new foundations of graphic design.","description":"By Rune Madsen","cover":null,"type":"resource"},{"id":35,"status":"published","url":"https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/demos.html","title":"Acoustics and Vibration Animations by Dr. Daniel A.

As well as explaining the underlying idea, I give examples of how the theory applies in practice. The lessons are further subdivided into modules covering specific aspects of Jazz. While they assume a minimal level of music theory and technical knowledge, they presume you know literally NOTHING about Jazz. As such, they start from a beginner level and gradually build up towards more advanced topics. These Jazz Piano Lessons cover everything you need to know to appreciate and play Jazz. By the end of these tutorials you should have a solid understanding of Jazz, and (with enough practice) be able to competently improvise and 'comp over any Jazz song.\\n\\nPlease also note that this website is a perennial work-in-progress. I will continue to add more Jazz Piano Lessons in the future to cover more topics and concepts.
