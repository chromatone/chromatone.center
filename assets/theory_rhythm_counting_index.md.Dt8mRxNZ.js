Commonly, this involves verbally counting the beats in each measure as they occur, whether there be 2 beats, 3 beats, 4 beats, or even 5 beats. In addition to helping to normalize the time taken up by each beat, counting allows easier identification of the beats that are stressed. Counting is most commonly used with rhythm (often to decipher a difficult rhythm) and form and often involves subdivision.</p><h2 id="introduction-to-systems-numbers-and-syllables" tabindex="-1">Introduction to Systems - Numbers and Syllables <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction-to-systems-numbers-and-syllables" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction to Systems - Numbers and Syllables&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The method involving numbers may be termed count chant, &quot;to identify it as a unique instructional process.&quot;</p><p>In lieu of simply counting the beats of a measure, other systems can be used which may be more appropriate to the particular piece of music. Depending on the tempo, the divisions of a beat may be vocalized as well (for slower times), or skipping numbers altogether (for faster times). As an alternative to counting, a metronome can be used to accomplish the same function.</p><p>Triple meter, such as 3/4, is often counted <strong>1 2 3</strong>, while compound meter, such as 6 8, is often counted in two and subdivided <strong>One-and-ah-Two-and-ah</strong> but may be articulated as <strong>One-la-lee-Two-la-lee</strong>.</p><p>For each subdivision employed a new syllable is used. For example, sixteenth notes in 4/4 are counted <strong>1 e &amp; a 2 e &amp; a 3 e &amp; a 4 e &amp; a</strong>, using numbers for the quarter note, &quot;&amp;&quot; for the eighth note, and &quot;e&quot; and &quot;a&quot; for the sixteenth note level.</p><p>Triplets may be counted <strong>1 tri ple 2 tri ple 3 tri ple 4 tri ple</strong> and sixteenth note triplets <strong>1 la li + la li 2 la li + la li</strong>. Quarter note triplets, due to their different rhythmic feel, may be articulated differently as <strong>1 dra git 3 dra git</strong>.</p><p>Rather than numbers or nonsense syllables, a random word may be assigned to a rhythm to clearly count each beat. An example is with a triplet, so that a triplet subdivision is often counted <strong>&quot;tri-po-let&quot;</strong>. The Kodály Method uses <strong>&quot;Ta&quot;</strong> for quarter notes and <strong>&quot;Ti-Ti&quot;</strong> for eighth notes. For sextuplets simply say triplet twice, while quintuplets may be articulated as <strong>&quot;un-i-vers-i-ty&quot;</strong>. In some approaches, &quot;rote-before-note&quot;, the fractional definitions of notes are not taught to children until after they are able to perform syllable or phrase-based versions of these rhythms.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;However the counting may be syllabized, the important skill is to keep the pulse steady and the division exact.&quot; – Alfred Blatter 2007</p></blockquote><h2 id="numbers-systems" tabindex="-1">Numbers Systems <a class="header-anchor" href="#numbers-systems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Numbers Systems&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="numbers" tabindex="-1">Numbers <a class="header-anchor" href="#numbers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Numbers&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Ultimately, musicians count using <strong>numbers</strong>, <strong>“ands”</strong> and vowel sounds. Downbeats within a measure are called <strong>1, 2, 3…</strong> Upbeats are represented with a plus sign and are called “and” (i.e. <strong>1 + 2 +</strong>), and further subdivisions receive the sounds “ee” and “uh” (i.e. <strong>1 e + a 2 e + a</strong>). Musicians do not agree on what to call triplets: some simply say the word triplet (“<strong>trip-a-let</strong>”), or another three-syllable word (like pineapple or elephant) with an antepenultimate accent. Some use numbers along with the word triplet (i.e. “<strong>1-trip-let</strong>”). Still others have devised sounds like “ah-lee” or “la-li” added after the number (i.e. <strong>1-la-li, 2-la-li</strong> or <strong>1-tee-duh, 2-tee-duh</strong>).</p><h3 id="traditional-american-system" tabindex="-1">Traditional American system <a class="header-anchor" href="#traditional-american-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Traditional American system&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Counts the beat <strong>number</strong> on the tactus, <strong>&amp;</strong> on the half beat, and <strong>n-e-&amp;-a</strong> for four sixteenth notes, <strong>n-&amp;-a</strong> for a triplet or three eighth notes in compound meter, where n is the beat number.</p><h3 id="eastman-system" tabindex="-1">Eastman System <a class="header-anchor" href="#eastman-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Eastman System&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The beat <strong>numbers</strong> are used for the tactus, <strong>te</strong> for the half beat, and <strong>n-ti-te-ta</strong> for four sixteenths.

The &quot;t&quot; consonant always falls on the main beat and beat division, and the &quot;k&quot; consonant is always when the beat divides again. Alternating &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; in quick succession is easy to say, as they fall on two different parts of the tongue, making it very easy to say these syllables at a fast tempo (much like tonguing on recorder or flute).
