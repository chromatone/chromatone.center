An example from Macedonia is the traditional tune "Jovano Jovanke", which can be transcribed in 7/8.

The most popular of these is the rachenitsa, a type of khoro in a rapid septuple meter divided 2+2+3. In the Pirin area, the khoro has a rhythm subdivided 3+2+2, and two varieties of it are the pravo makedonsko ("straight Macedonian") and the mazhka rachenitsa ("men's rachenitsa").

Additive patterns also occur in some music of Philip Glass, and other minimalists, most noticeably the "one-two-one-two-three" chorus parts in Einstein on the Beach. They may also occur in passing in pieces which are on the whole in conventional meters. In jazz, Dave Brubeck's song "Blue Rondo à la Turk" features bars of nine quavers grouped into patterns of 2+2+2+3 at the start. George Harrison's song "Here Comes the Sun" on the Beatles' album Abbey Road features a rhythm "which switches between 11/8, 4/4 and 7/8 on the bridge".
