Having beatmatched two songs, the DJ can either seamlessly crossfade from one song to another, or play both tracks simultaneously, creating a layered effect.",-1),g=e("p",null,"DJs often beatmatch the underlying tempos of recordings, rather than their strict BPM value suggested by the kick drum, particularly when dealing with high tempo tracks. A 240 BPM track, for example, matches the beat of a 120 BPM track without slowing down or speeding up, because both have an underlying tempo of 120 quarter notes per minute. Thus, some soul music (around 75–90 BPM) mixes well with a drum and bass beat (from 150–185 BPM). When speeding up or slowing down a record on a turntable, the pitch and tempo of a track are linked: spinning a disc 10% faster makes both pitch and tempo 10% higher. Software processing to change the pitch without changing the tempo is called pitch-shifting. The opposite operation, changing the tempo without changing the pitch, is called time-stretching.",-1);function f(b,y,w,q,P,v){const t=s;return l(),r("div",null,[h,o(t,{video:"2UphAzryVpY"}),m,o(t,{video:"GH2k8GccrqI"}),p,c,d,g])}const T=n(u,[["render",f]]);export{B as __pageData,T as default};
