There are four basic single strokes.</p><h3 id="double-stroke" tabindex="-1">Double stroke <a class="header-anchor" href="#double-stroke" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Double stroke&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A double stroke consists of two single strokes played by the same hand (either RR or LL).</p><h3 id="diddle" tabindex="-1">Diddle <a class="header-anchor" href="#diddle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Diddle&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A diddle is a double stroke played at the current prevailing speed of the piece. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any diddles in that passage would consist of sixteenth notes.</p><h3 id="paradiddle" tabindex="-1">Paradiddle <a class="header-anchor" href="#paradiddle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Paradiddle&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A paradiddle consists of two single strokes followed by a double stroke, i.e., RLRR or LRLL. When multiple paradiddles are played in succession, the first note always alternates between right and left. Therefore, a single paradiddle is often used to switch the &quot;lead hand&quot; in drumming music. Mill Stroke</p><p>A mill stroke is essentially a reversed paradiddle with the sticking RRLR or LLRL with an accent on the first note. The single flammed mill is the most common mill stroke variant in American playing.</p><h3 id="drag" tabindex="-1">Drag <a class="header-anchor" href="#drag" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Drag&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A drag is a double stroke played at twice the speed of the context in which it is placed. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any drags in that passage would consist of thirty-second notes. Drags can also be notated as grace notes, in which case the spacing between the notes can be interpreted by the player. On timpani, drags are often played with alternating sticking (lrL or rlR).</p><p>In Scottish pipe band snare drumming, a drag consists of a flam where the gracenote is played as a &quot;deadstick&quot; (staccato note).[citation needed]</p><h3 id="ruff" tabindex="-1">Ruff <a class="header-anchor" href="#ruff" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ruff&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Historically, the modern Drag was known as a Ruff (or Rough) if played closed and a Half Drag when played open. Ruff can also refer to a single stroked set of grace notes preceding a regular note. In American playing the 3 Stroke Ruff has 2 single stroked grace notes before the primary or full note and a 4 Stroke Ruff has 3 singles before the primary note. Other rudimental systems have differing sticking methods and names for similar notation figures. Though still used and taught by drummers and drum teachers in practice, the 3 Stroke Ruff and 4 Stroke Ruff are not officially listed on the NARD or PAS rudiment sheets and the term Drag has eclipsed Ruff (or Rough) for the double stroked rudiments, in both open or closed execution, according to the current PAS standard terminology.</p><h3 id="flam" tabindex="-1">Flam <a class="header-anchor" href="#flam" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flam&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A flam consists of two single strokes played by alternating hands (rL or lR). The first stroke is a quieter grace note followed by a louder primary stroke on the opposite hand. The two notes are played almost simultaneously, and are intended to sound like a single, broader note. The temporal distance between the grace note and the primary note can vary depending on the style and context of the piece being played. In the past, or in some European systems, open flams and closed flams were listed as separate rudiments.</p><h3 id="charge-stroke" tabindex="-1">Charge Stroke <a class="header-anchor" href="#charge-stroke" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Charge Stroke&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A charge stroke is a special variation on an open flam in which one or both of the notes are accented to provide a driving feel that can create the illusion that the downbeat has moved earlier in time. The two major types are French Lr or Rl and Swiss LR or RL with the first note preceding the downbeat, which falls on the second note, in both types. Charge strokes can be combined with flams or drags to create complex grace note figures preceding a downbeat.</p><h3 id="roll" tabindex="-1">Roll <a class="header-anchor" href="#roll" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Roll&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Drum rolls are various techniques employed to produce a sustained, continuous sound.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_rudiment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_rudiment</a></p><p><a href="https://www.drumeo.com/beat/rudiments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.drumeo.com/beat/rudiments/</a></p><h3 id="practice-drum-rudiments-online-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="./../../../practice/rhythm/rudiments/">Practice drum rudiments online</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-drum-rudiments-online-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Practice drum rudiments online](../../../practice/rhythm/rudiments/index.md)&quot;">​</a></h3>',24);function h(c,u,m,p,f,g){const e=i;return l(),o("div",null,[a(e,{video:"WSC7iujjg_o"}),s,a(e,{video:"roT6Imp7lSg"}),d])}const y=r(n,[["render",h]]);export{T as __pageData,y as default};
