Contrast in each of these may be present or absent, and when accentuation or tone contrasts are present they may be regular or irregular.

Sometimes this essential feature will be merely an isochronous pulsation without any recognizable periodicity. At other times, the music will be characterized by unique periodic patterns. These special rhythms are generally called <strong>timelines</strong>.* Timelines should be distinguished from the more general term rhythmic ostinatos. A rhythmic <strong>ostinato</strong> (from the word obstinate) refers to a rhythm or phrase that is continually repeated during a musical piece. Timelines, on the other hand, are more particular ostinatos that are easily recognized and remembered, play a distinguished role in the music, and also serve the functions of conductor and regulator, by signaling to other musicians the fundamen- tal cyclic structure of the piece. Thus, timelines act as an orienting device that facilitates musicians to stay together and helps soloists navigate the rhythmic landscape offered by the other instruments.</p><p>In ethnomusicology, the use of the word timeline is generally limited to asymmetric durational patterns of sub-Saharan origin such as the <strong>tresillo</strong>. In this book, however, the term is expanded to cover similar notions used in other cultures such as <strong>compás</strong> in the flamenco music of Southern Spain, <strong>tala</strong> in India, <strong>loop</strong> in electronic dance music (EDM), and just plain rhythmic ostinatos in any type of music. A word is in order concerning the ubiquitous related concept referred to as meter in Western music. There is slightly less vagueness present in the many definitions of <strong>meter</strong> published, as there is of the definitions of rhythm listed above. There is also much discussion about the differences between meter and rhythm. Meter is usually defined in terms of a hierarchy of accent pat- terns, and considered to be more regular than rhythm. Some music, such as sub-Saharan African music is claimed to have only pulsation as a temporal reference, and no meter in the strict sense of the word. Christopher Hasty’s book titled Meter as Rhythm considers meter to be a special case of rhythm. In this book, the word “timeline” is expanded to include all those meters used in music around the world, that function as time-keepers, or ostinatos, and determine the predominant underlying rhythmic structure of a piece. Here, meter is viewed as just another rhythm that may be sounded or merely felt by the performer or listener, and it is also represented as a binary sequence. While consideration of a metric context is indispensable for a complete understanding of rhythm, the underlying assumption in this book is that it can also be profitable to focus on purely inter-onset durational issues.</p>',3)),i(t,{video:"uDhwFTw4VnI"}),e[2]||(e[2]=o("p",null,[o("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_rhythm_and_divisive_rhythm",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_rhythm_and_divisive_rhythm")],-1))])}const w=s(m,[["render",d]]);export{b as __pageData,w as default};
