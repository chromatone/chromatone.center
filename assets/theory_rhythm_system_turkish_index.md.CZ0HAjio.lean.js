An usul can be as short as two beats or as long as 128 beats. Usul is often translated as &quot;meter&quot;, but usul and meter are not exactly the same. Both are repeating rhythmic patterns with more or less complex inner structures of beats of differing duration and weight. But a student learning Turkish music in the traditional meşk system first memorizes the usul kinetically by striking the knees with the hands. The student then sings the vocal or instrumental composition while performing the underlying usul. This pedagogical system helps the student memorize the composition while internalizing the underlying rhythmic structure.</p><p>Usul patterns have standard pronounceable vocables built from combinations of the syllables düm, dü-üm, tek, tekkyaa, teke, te-ek, where düm, dü-üm indicate a strong low beat of single or double duration, and tek, tekkya, teke, te-ek indicate various combinations of light beats of half, single or double duration. Long usuls (e.g., 28/4, 32/4, 120/4) are compound metric structures that underlie longer sections of entire compositions.</p><p>In Ottoman times, the usul was realized by drummers. Drums are generally omitted in modern performances except for Mevlevi. When performing music for the Mevlevi ceremony, drummers traditionally play embellished (velveleli) versions of the usuls.</p><p>Instrumental improvisations (taksim) and vocal improvisations (gazel, mersiye, etc.) are generally performed in &quot;free&quot; rhythm, with no usul.</p><p>The melodic counterpart to usul rhythmic mode is makam melodic mode. The parallel system to usul in Indian music is tala.</p><h1 id="turkish-usuls-and-aksak-rhythms-a-comprehensive-guide" tabindex="-1">Turkish Usuls and Aksak Rhythms: A Comprehensive Guide <a class="header-anchor" href="#turkish-usuls-and-aksak-rhythms-a-comprehensive-guide" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Turkish Usuls and Aksak Rhythms: A Comprehensive Guide&quot;">​</a></h1><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Turkish music is renowned for its complex rhythmic structures, which form an integral part of both classical Ottoman music and Turkish folk traditions. Two key concepts in Turkish rhythm are Usul and Aksak.</p><h3 id="usul" tabindex="-1">Usul <a class="header-anchor" href="#usul" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Usul&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Usul (plural: usuller) is the Turkish term for rhythmic cycle or meter. It&#39;s comparable to time signature in Western music, but often more complex. Usuller can range from simple patterns of a few beats to intricate cycles of over 100 beats. They provide the rhythmic foundation for Turkish classical and folk music.</p><h3 id="aksak" tabindex="-1">Aksak <a class="header-anchor" href="#aksak" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Aksak&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Aksak, meaning &quot;limping&quot; in Turkish, refers to asymmetrical rhythms that combine units of 2 and 3 beats. These rhythms are characteristic of Turkish and Balkan music, creating a distinctive &quot;limping&quot; or &quot;uneven&quot; feel. While all aksak rhythms are usuller, not all usuller are aksak.</p><h3 id="note-on-rhythm-notation" tabindex="-1">Note on Rhythm Notation <a class="header-anchor" href="#note-on-rhythm-notation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Note on Rhythm Notation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In this guide, we notate the rhythms using 16th notes (e.g., 5/16, 7/16) rather than 8th notes. This choice reflects the traditionally fast tempo at which many of these usuls are performed. In classical Turkish music, these rhythms are often played at a pace where each notated beat (16th note) corresponds roughly to one pulse, typically ranging from 80 to 120 beats per minute for the 16th note, depending on the specific usul and the nature of the piece.</p><p>However, it&#39;s important to note that tempo can vary widely based on the style of music, the specific composition, and the performer&#39;s interpretation. Some slower pieces or more contemporary interpretations might take a more relaxed tempo.</p><p>In the following descriptions, we use &quot;X&quot; to represent the main strong beat (düm in Turkish percussion terminology), &quot;x&quot; for secondary beats (tek), and &quot;.&quot; for silent beats.</p><h2 id="detailed-rhythm-descriptions" tabindex="-1">Detailed Rhythm Descriptions <a class="header-anchor" href="#detailed-rhythm-descriptions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Detailed Rhythm Descriptions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="_5-16-turk-aksagı" tabindex="-1">5/16 Türk Aksağı <a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-16-turk-aksagı" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;5/16 Türk Aksağı&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Pattern: X.x..

The aksak patterns, in particular, showcase the sophisticated interplay between long and short beats that gives Turkish music its distinctive character. From the basic 5/16 Türk Aksağı to the complex 25/16 Kapalı Curcuna, these rhythms form a unique rhythmic language that is integral to the expression and emotion of Turkish music.</p><p>The use of 16th note time signatures reflects the traditionally brisk pace of many usul performances in classical Turkish music. This rapid pulse contributes to the music&#39;s energetic and intricate character, allowing for subtle subdivisions and complex interplays between rhythm and melody.</p><p>Understanding these rhythms not only provides insight into Turkish music but also offers a gateway to appreciating the diverse and intricate rhythmic systems found in music traditions around the world. The speed and complexity of these rhythms challenge musicians to develop high levels of rhythmic precision and listeners to engage with music in new and exciting ways.</p>',47))])}}});export{q as __pageData,v as default};
