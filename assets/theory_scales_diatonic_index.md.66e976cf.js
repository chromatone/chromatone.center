The first, third, and fifth degrees form a chord known as a major triad, which can be found in related major scales, like the harmonic major scale, which has a minor sixth triad.

Jazz and blues make excellent use of the Mixolydian mode."},minor:{title:"Minor",chroma:"101101011010",description:"The Aeolian, or natural minor mode, opens with the A note on the white keys of a piano keyboard, and follows the same scale degrees as the major scale, except for its minor third. Like the Dorian mode, it has a melancholy sound with an extra degree of sadness."},locarian:{title:"Locrian",chroma:"110101101010",description:"The seventh and final mode, Locrian, is also one of the least employed modes due to its dark and minor sound built around the B note. Like the Dorian, Aeolian, and Phrygian, the Locrian has a minor third, but also a minor second and fifth; the latter gives the mode a sense of being interrupted or unfinished.
