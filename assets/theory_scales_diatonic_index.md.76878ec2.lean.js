The first, third, and fifth degrees form a chord known as a major triad, which can be found in related major scales, like the harmonic major scale, which has a minor sixth triad. The melodic major scale, also known as the Aeolian dominant scale, has lowered sixth and seventh degrees."},dorian:{title:"Dorian",chroma:"101101010110",description:"The modern Dorian mode, also known as the Russian mode, is built around the D note, the second note on the major scale. Music experts consider it a minor chord because its third note is a minor third, meaning that it’s lowered by a half step and a flattened seventh note, which results in a melancholy sound."},phrygian:{title:"Phrygian",chroma:"110101011010",description:"The Phrygian scale, which begins on the E note, the third on the major scale, and ends at E major, is considered a minor chord due to its abundance of minor notes (second, third, sixth, and seventh), and as such, is infrequently used. Its dominant sound is somewhat exotic; flamenco music from Spain is often written in Phrygian mode."},lydian:{title:"Lydian",chroma:"101010110101",description:"The fourth mode, Lydian, is a bright-sounding mode that begins with the F note. It’s similar to the major scale with one exception: its fourth scale degree is raised by a semitone."},myxolydian:{title:"Myxolydian",chroma:"101011010110",description:"Also known as the dominant mode, the fifth mode, Mixolydian, covers G to G major on the keyboard and, like the Lydian mode, very similar to the major scale save for its seventh note, which is lowered by a semitone. Jazz and blues make excellent use of the Mixolydian mode."},minor:{title:"Minor",chroma:"101101011010",description:"The Aeolian, or natural minor mode, opens with the A note on the white keys of a piano keyboard, and follows the same scale degrees as the major scale, except for its minor third. Like the Dorian mode, it has a melancholy sound with an extra degree of sadness."},locarian:{title:"Locrian",chroma:"110101101010",description:"The seventh and final mode, Locrian, is also one of the least employed modes due to its dark and minor sound built around the B note. Like the Dorian, Aeolian, and Phrygian, the Locrian has a minor third, but also a minor second and fifth; the latter gives the mode a sense of being interrupted or unfinished.
