As the name implies, it is primarily used in jazz. It may be derived from the major scale with a minor third, making it a synthetic scale, and features a dominant seventh chord on the fifth degree (V) like the harmonic minor scale. Also known as the heptatonia seconda, jazz minor scale, Athenian Scale, or Ionian ♭3. This form of the scale is also the 5th mode of the acoustic scale.

It is on the second degree of the jazz minor scale. Without the minor second above the root, the scale would just be the Dorian mode. The reason it is also known as Phrygian ♯6 is because if the scale did not have the major 6th then it would be enharmonic with the Phrygian mode.

This scale is commonly used in Assyrian music, most especially in the folk dance genre. Though to add color and to retain the Phrygian tradition of Assyrian music, the major sixth may at times be simultaneously altered to the minor sixth during the course of the composition.

Generically the whole and half steps are:
-  W -  W -  W -  W -  H -  W -  H -

The scale may be thought of as a major scale with an augmented fourth and fifth, or as the relative to the melodic minor ascending scale (C Lydian augmented and A melodic minor ascending share the same notes).

This differs from the major scale in having an augmented fourth and a minor seventh scale degree. It is the fourth mode of the melodic minor ascending scale.[4][5] The term 'acoustic scale' is sometimes used to describe a particular mode of this seven-note collection (e.g. the specific ordering C–D–E–F♯–G–A–B♭) and is sometimes used to describe the collection as a whole (e.g. including orderings such as E–F♯–G–A–B♭–C–D)."},melmaj:{title:"Melodic major",roman:"V",chroma:"101011011010",link:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_dominant_scale",description:`The Melodic Major (also known as the Aeolian dominant scale, Olympian Scale, Mixolydian ♭6 [or ♭13], Aeolian major, and Hindu Scale) is the fifth mode of the melodic minor scale. It is named such because it is seen as a justifying the Augmented second in the harmonic major scale, by flattening the 7th, making it closer to the sixth, and thus closing the Augmented Second. Aeolian dominant typically refers to music that uses the scale both ascending and descending, whereas melodic major is used for music that ascends in the major scale and descends in aeolian dominant.

It corresponds to Raga Charukeshi in Indian Classical music.

This scale can also be obtained by raising the third degree of the natural minor scale or lowering the sixth degree of the mixolydian scale.

This means that it comprises the three irreducibly essential tones that define a dominant seventh chord, which are root, major third, and minor seventh and that all other chord tones have been altered. These are:

the fifth is altered to a ♭5 and a ♯5
the ninth is altered to a ♭9 and a ♯9
the eleventh is altered to a ♯11 (equivalent to a ♭5)
the thirteenth is altered to a ♭13 (equivalent to a ♯5)
