One of the most common approaches to organizing musical structures is known as the Mode or Mode(s). Since the Heian Period, there has been disagreement and contention between musical scholars regarding Japanese music and modal theory. There has long been a debate about Japanese modes and what defines them, to this day there is not a single modal theory that can completely explain Japanese music. Music scales are critical in clarifying and identifying musical pieces, however, there has been no single scale model that can identify all Japanese music into one classification or category of music. In order to be understood by western scholars, The different variations of Japanese modal scales are often compared to the western Major Scale. Various modal theories from around the world have been imported to attempt and analyze Japanese music structure, but often the modal theories suggested do not reflect what is actually present in the music it is being applied to. The classical structures of most Japanese music originates in China and was not concerned with developing a universal scale or mode until Western music had been imported. After the Heian period began was when Western modal theories became widely acknowledged by Japanese society, though it often stayed in its own category as it could not entirely explain Japanese music across all its different iterations.",-1),f=e("p",null,"The most common version of the Japanese mode is a somewhat inaccurate term for a pentatonic musical scale which is used commonly in traditional Japanese music. The intervals of the scale are major second, minor third, perfect fifth, and minor sixth (for example, the notes A, B, C, E, F and up to A.) - which is essentially a natural minor scale in Western music theory without the subdominant and subtonic, which is the same operation performed on the major scale to produce the pentatonic major scale.
