The place theory suggests that each part of the cochlea resonates at a different frequency, with the stapes end resonating at high frequencies and the end furthest from the ossicles resonating at low frequencies. When a given frequency is presented to the cochlea, it causes motion in only one part, which sends a nerve impulse to the brain, enabling the perception of that frequency. However, the place theory has limitations, as the resonance curves are broad and overlap, making it difficult for the ear to distinguish frequencies that are close together.",-1),g=e("p",null,"The temporal theory of hearing is another overlapping theory that aims to explain the richness of auditory phenomena experienced by humans. Unlike the place theory, the temporal theory focuses on the timing of neural activity, suggesting that the brain processes temporal information to perceive sound. This theory posits that the brain uses the timing of neural activity to distinguish between different frequencies, even when the resonance curves of the cochlea overlap.
