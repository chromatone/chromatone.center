Distortion is most commonly used with the electric guitar, but may also be used with other electric instruments such as electric bass, electric piano, synthesizer and Hammond organ. Guitarists playing electric blues originally obtained an overdriven sound by turning up their vacuum tube-powered guitar amplifiers to high volumes, which caused the signal to distort. While overdriven tube amps are still used to obtain overdrive, especially in genres like blues and rockabilly, a number of other ways to produce distortion have been developed since the 1960s, such as distortion effect pedals. The growling tone of a distorted electric guitar is a key part of many genres, including blues and many rock music genres, notably hard rock, punk rock, hardcore punk, acid rock, and heavy metal music, while the use of distorted bass has been essential in a genre of hip hop music and alternative hip hop known as "SoundCloud rap".',-1)),a(i,{video:"7dLArMd-y64"}),e[1]||(e[1]=o("",17)),a(i,{video:"DZ4IGAR7iio"}),e[2]||(e[2]=t("h2",{id:"theory-and-circuits",tabindex:"-1"},[l("Theory and circuits "),t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#theory-and-circuits","aria-label":'Permalink to "Theory and circuits"'},"â€‹")],-1)),e[3]||(e[3]=t("p",null,"Waveform plot showing the different types of clipping.

In music the different forms of linear distortion have specific names describing them. The simplest of these is a distortion process known as "volume adjustment", which involves distorting the amplitude of a sound wave in a proportional (or 'linear') way in order to increase or decrease the volume of the sound without affecting the tone quality. In the context of music, the most common source of (nonlinear) distortion is clipping in amplifier circuits and is most commonly known as overdrive.`,-1)),e[5]||(e[5]=t("p",null,`Clipping is a non-linear process that produces frequencies not originally present in the audio signal.
