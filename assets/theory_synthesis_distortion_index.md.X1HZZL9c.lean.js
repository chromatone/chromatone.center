Distortion is most commonly used with the electric guitar, but may also be used with other electric instruments such as electric bass, electric piano, synthesizer and Hammond organ. Guitarists playing electric blues originally obtained an overdriven sound by turning up their vacuum tube-powered guitar amplifiers to high volumes, which caused the signal to distort. While overdriven tube amps are still used to obtain overdrive, especially in genres like blues and rockabilly, a number of other ways to produce distortion have been developed since the 1960s, such as distortion effect pedals. The growling tone of a distorted electric guitar is a key part of many genres, including blues and many rock music genres, notably hard rock, punk rock, hardcore punk, acid rock, and heavy metal music, while the use of distorted bass has been essential in a genre of hip hop music and alternative hip hop known as "SoundCloud rap".',-1),h=a("",17),c=e("h2",{id:"theory-and-circuits",tabindex:"-1"},[n("Theory and circuits "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#theory-and-circuits","aria-label":'Permalink to "Theory and circuits"'},"â€‹")],-1),p=e("p",null,"Waveform plot showing the different types of clipping.

In music the different forms of linear distortion have specific names describing them. The simplest of these is a distortion process known as "volume adjustment", which involves distorting the amplitude of a sound wave in a proportional (or 'linear') way in order to increase or decrease the volume of the sound without affecting the tone quality. In the context of music, the most common source of (nonlinear) distortion is clipping in amplifier circuits and is most commonly known as overdrive.`,-1),g=e("p",null,`Clipping is a non-linear process that produces frequencies not originally present in the audio signal. These frequencies can be harmonic overtones, meaning they are whole number multiples of one of the signal's original frequencies, or "inharmonic", resulting from general intermodulation distortion. The same nonlinear device will produce both types of distortion, depending on the input signal. Intermodulation occurs whenever the input frequencies are not already harmonically related. For instance, playing a power chord through distortion results in intermodulation that produces new subharmonics.`,-1),f=e("p",null,'"Soft clipping" gradually flattens the peaks of a signal which creates a number of higher harmonics which share a harmonic relationship with the original tone. "Hard clipping" flattens peaks abruptly, resulting in higher power in higher harmonics. As clipping increases, a tone input progressively begins to resemble a square wave which has odd number harmonics. This is generally described as sounding "harsh".',-1),v=e("p",null,"Distortion and overdrive circuits each 'clip' the signal before it reaches the main amplifier (clean boost circuits do not necessarily create 'clipping') as well as boost signals to levels that cause distortion to occur at the main amplifier's front end stage (by exceeding the ordinary input signal amplitude, thus overdriving the amplifier) Note : product names may not accurately reflect type of circuit involved - see above.",-1),y=e("p",null,"A fuzz box alters an audio signal until it is nearly a square wave and adds complex overtones by way of a frequency multiplier.",-1),b=a("",42);function w(q,k,z,T,x,_){const t=o;return l(),s("div",null,[i(t,{video:"4QeqSYIXDr4"}),u,i(t,{video:"7dLArMd-y64"}),h,i(t,{video:"DZ4IGAR7iio"}),c,p,m,g,f,v,y,i(t,{video:"YuojAtE8YCY"}),b])}const M=r(d,[["render",w]]);export{I as __pageData,M as default};
