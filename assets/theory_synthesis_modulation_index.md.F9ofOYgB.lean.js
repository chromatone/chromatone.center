This is because it is impractical to transmit signals with low frequencies. Generally, to receive a radio wave one needs a radio antenna with length that is one-fourth of wavelength. For low frequency radio waves, wavelength is on the scale of kilometers and building such a large antenna is not practical. In radio communication, the modulated carrier is transmitted through space as a radio wave to a radio receiver.</p><p>Another purpose of modulation is to transmit multiple channels of information through a single communication medium, using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). For example, in cable television (which uses FDM), many carrier signals, each modulated with a different television channel, are transported through a single cable to customers. Since each carrier occupies a different frequency, the channels do not interfere with each other. At the destination end, the carrier signal is demodulated to extract the information bearing modulation signal.</p><p>A modulator is a device or circuit that performs modulation. A demodulator (sometimes detector) is a circuit that performs demodulation, the inverse of modulation. A modem (from modulator–demodulator), used in bidirectional communication, can perform both operations. The lower frequency band occupied by the modulation signal is called the baseband, while the higher frequency band occupied by the modulated carrier is called the passband.[citation needed]</p><p>In analog modulation, an analog modulation signal is &quot;impressed&quot; on the carrier. Examples are amplitude modulation (AM) in which the amplitude (strength) of the carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal, and frequency modulation (FM) in which the frequency of the carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal. These were the earliest types of modulation[citation needed], and are used to transmit an audio signal representing sound in AM and FM radio broadcasting. More recent systems use digital modulation, which impresses a digital signal consisting of a sequence of binary digits (bits), a bitstream, on the carrier, by means of mapping bits to elements from a discrete alphabet to be transmitted. This alphabet can consist of a set of real or complex numbers, or sequences, like oscillations of different frequencies, so-called frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation. A more complicated digital modulation method that employs multiple carriers, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), is used in WiFi networks, digital radio stations and digital cable television transmission.</p><h2 id="analog-modulation-methods" tabindex="-1">Analog modulation methods <a class="header-anchor" href="#analog-modulation-methods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Analog modulation methods&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In analog modulation, the modulation is applied continuously in response to the analog information signal.
