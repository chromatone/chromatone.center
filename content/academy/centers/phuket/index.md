## Makerspace on the island

Thanks to Glenn Miller at the tropical island of Phuket there's Pirate Bay - the new fablab space for makers of different crafts to meet and collaborate on creative projects. It is located in the middle of Phuket Town and hosts a number of regular meetups for local communities.
