## Makerspace on the island

Thanks to Glenn Miller at the tropical island of Phuket there's Pirate Bay - the new fablab space for makers of different crafts to meet and collaborate on creative projects. It is located in the middle of Phuket Town and hosts a number of regular meetups for local communities.

## Weekly Music Geeks Meetups

We are exploring the realm of visual music representations by getting together to learn and practice music. We are open for participation and collaboration in any music projects.

Every Thursday at Pirate Bay we have a Music Geeks Meetup. Everyone, who is interested in any way of music, can come and share their passions with other curious people. We jam some grooves, share some ideas and thoughts and then try to combine all that into some creative output like a performance, a recording, a music instrument, or a whole setup of them.

The community oscillates, people come and go, but the format grows and builds momentum. So see you next Thursday at 7 PM at Pirate Bay!
