Hi! We are a growing international community of music learners and explorers. We use new ways to look at music theory and collaboration. We dive deep, jam much and are open for everyone to participate. We have weekly gatherings on Thursdays at 7 PM in Pirate Bay space located in Phuket Town. It's our 11th meetup and we have so much to share and explore. Feel free to come and bring friends to have music talks, jams and projects together. Basic English is enough, no prior music knowledge is required.

See you this Thursday! https://goo.gl/maps/GCMkq3vuTaw8PM68A
