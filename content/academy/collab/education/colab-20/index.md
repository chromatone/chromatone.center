The first and only music co-working in Moscow invited us to give an overview lecture on music theory from the point of view of the Chromatone system. The lecture took place on October 7, 2020 and turned out to be quite eventful. The pandemic imposed its limitations and not many people were able to gather live in Colab. But for everyone else, there's a video of this streaming narrative.
