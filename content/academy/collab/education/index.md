First public introduction of Chromatone system happened at [NAMM 2019 Exhibition in Moscow](./namm-19/index.md). A year after there was an extended lecture in [Colab](./colab-20/index.md). Next year we've created a whole [Visual Music Theory video course](./skillbox/index.md) with Skillbox online education company.  

We are open for new educational content collaborations. Chromatone is the platform to produce it for different audiences. In high quality and with good music theory expertise.
