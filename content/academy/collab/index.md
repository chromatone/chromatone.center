Music helps gather people together for millenia and music education may be as fun and entertaining so we finally can merge performers and audience into playful music collaborators. Workshops, lectures and courses are all purposed to help people have fun playing music together. But it's a journey to take! Educational events and content produced is a way to get there.

Chromatone is ready to be used in a multitude of music educational products like courses, workshops, posters, stickers and, of course, web-apps. We are ready to get involved in any of these directions and we are glad to meet new companies to collaborate with.
