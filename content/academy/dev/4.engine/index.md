A couple of weeks past from previous video about just the first steps in exporation of the newly opened to public Elementary audio library. Now we got some progress with a number of layers of Vue 3 composables that are used to render UI and audio.

In this video we'll be exploring the architecture of a polyphonic synthesizer, drum machine and all the beautiful audio analysis tools, that act like probes in audio graph. We share some insight on how to make all of these functions as pluggable and composable as possible.

It's not a final product, it's just a snapshot of days of research and experimentation. I made it for other web audio enthusiasts to have this example as a reference for the ideation and build process. And soon all these functionalities will come to every page of the site and even further to the `use-chromatone` NPM package and thousands of new modules and web based music projects.
