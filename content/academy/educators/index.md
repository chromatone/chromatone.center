    pos: Author of the Chromatone system
    place: Based in Phuket, Thailand
    about: I've took the job to bring the colorful music concepts to a level of modern human understanding. I use illustrations, videos and interactive web-apps to teach people of all ages and any level of prior music knowledge. I can visualize almost any music theory concept on which we can elaborate to produce a much deeper understanding of these concepts in your mind. My main focus is on live improvisation skills that can be developed gradually and with comfort of modern technology. So I hope to help grow more free and independent musicianship.

We're building an international community of the visual music theory teachers and practitioners. It all starts from the founder of the system and grows exponentially as a net of those who learn to see music in color. Learners become teachers with time. And the cycle goes on.

You can bring Chromatone to lectures, workshops or performances at your place. We're open to any kind of collaboration!
