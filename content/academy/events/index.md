We are exploring the realm of visual music representations by getting together to learn and practice music. We are open for participation and collaboration in any music projects. And [Music Geeks Meetups](./mgm/index.md) is our regular collaborative music events laboratory. It's open and free, thanks to the welcoming [Pirate Bay FabLab](../centers/phuket/index.md).
