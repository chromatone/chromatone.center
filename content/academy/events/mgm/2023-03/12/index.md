Join us for the next Music Geeks Meetup event on March 9th, where music lovers from around the world will come together to share their love of music, connect with one another, and create something special.

The event will start at 7:00 PM with an hour of interactive talks about music passions, followed by a music jam session from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, where you can bring your instruments and join in the fun as we create music together.

Finally, from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, we'll come together to create something unique as a group. Whether it's a performance, a song, or a musical instrument, we'll work as a team to produce something truly special.

All music lovers are welcome, regardless of their background or experience. Don't miss this opportunity to connect with fellow music geeks and create something beautiful together.

We hope to see you there
