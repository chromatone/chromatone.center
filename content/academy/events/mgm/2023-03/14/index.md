Quite quiet, yet very productive meetup!

- Sino brought his electronic drums kit to the Pirate Bay for us to play with
- Guitar stickers upgraded
- New ukulele with fresh stickers too
- Glenn tried playing drums for the first time and got it quite fast

And many music theory insights that happened through all these activities. âœ¨
