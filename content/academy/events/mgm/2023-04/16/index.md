Our first live stream on Chromatone YouTube channel. Just two subscribers, two viewers of the stream and just the two music geeks, who gathered this Thursday 06 April 2023 just before the Songkran festival here in Phuket, Thailand.

We are having weekly music meetups for 16 weeks straight and now as Thai people are quite busy with all the holiday preparations we could build a nice live streaming setup to run our first one hour music production session together with Alex.
