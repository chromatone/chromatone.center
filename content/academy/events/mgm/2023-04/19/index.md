Vadim and Natasha brought some nice instruments to play with: the metal drum with a nice contact mic got us to some space vibes and electric guitar with the fance effects plugins made the sound trip even more deep. 

Alex played Vadim's electric guitar with fancy effect plugins on top. 

We recorded a bunch of nice demos together.
