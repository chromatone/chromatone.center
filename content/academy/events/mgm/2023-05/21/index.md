Music Geeks Meetup #21 - the live streaming music research with Denis and Alex. It's a recap of the event and of the whole stream available at Chromatone YouTube channel.

"We've been experimenting with 5/4 time signature to find some groovy beats to build on. And we've got some nice side-chained double bass-line with fancy arpeggiator line on top of basic beat."

We make these streams to deliver the idea of what may be happening at Music Geeks Meetups here. Feel free to come to the Pirate Bay next Thursday at 19:00! The format is very flexible and we can collaborate with people of any level of music and English knowledge. 

Bring your own instruments or play the public ones, get into small talks about your music passions or collaborate with other musicians in jams, production and other creative processes. 

You can come just to watch and listen too. See you! ðŸ‘€
