Music helps gather people together for millenia and music education may be as fun and entertaining so we finally can merge performers and audience into playful music collaborators. Workshops, lectures and courses are all purposed to help people have fun playing music together. But it's a journey to take! Educational events and content produced is a way to get there.

There's some lectures and courses [in Russian language](ru/index.md) and there will be much more!
