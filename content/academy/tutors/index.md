    place: Based in Phuket, Thailand
    about: I've took the job to bring the colorful music concepts to a level of modern human understanding. I use illustrations, videos and interactive web-apps to teach people of all ages and any level of prior music knowledge. I can visualize almost any music theory concept on which we can elaborate to produce a much deeper understanding of these concepts in your mind. My main focus is on live improvisation skills that can be developed gradually and with comfort of modern technology. So I hope to help grow more free and independent musicianship.

## Chromatone tutors

Becoming a Chromatone tutor represents an exciting journey, not just in self-discovery, but in lighting paths for others as well. Armed with a broad understanding of music and color theory, Chromatone tutors play an integral role in simplifying the often intricate world of music for learners, using vivid visuals to clarify complex concepts.

A world comes alive on screen through the Chromatone web-app, used extensively by tutors as their master palette. It provides a platform to 'color' the essence of music for students, transforming abstract musical concepts into vibrant, interactive sessions. Through this lens, understanding notes, intervals, chords, scales, harmony, rhythm, timbre, melody, and composition becomes more intuitive.

Using colorful stickers and memo-cards, tutors infuse a playful dimension into their teaching, stimulating information retention through these visually captivating tools. These educational aids are more than just vibrant add-ons. They are bridges connecting theory with practice, leading to a deeper, more tactile grasp of music.

By passing a comprehensive test that measures their knowledge and pedagogy, these individuals earn their place in the list of affirmed Chromatone tutors. Beyond this recognition, tutors are the heart of growing a thriving visual music community. Their shared knowledge and passion for Chromatone lay the groundwork for learners everywhere to venture into this innovative style of music perception. By guiding students towards a common understanding of music, tutors foster a space where individuals can meet and interact deeply through music, thus helping the visual music community to prosper and expand. Embracing the Chromatone way of teaching forms the foundation of a vibrant learning community that is constantly evolving, where music becomes a more accessible, engaging, and colorful experience for all.
