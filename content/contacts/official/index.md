Chromatone is a self sustaining ecosystem of music learners, music teachers and new tools to learn, practice, compose and perform music visually. The source code for them is open and is developed as an internationally funded social initiative.

Our mission is to build a complete visual music ecosystem built by international community of learners, teachers and performers. With open music labs as the new form of real time creative collaboration.

The stickers sales bring fuel to the research and development. Charity funding is very welcome! âœ¨
