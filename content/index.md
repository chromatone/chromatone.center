Chromatone is an ongoing research and experiment to use induced a synchronised artificial synesthesia for personal music learning and exploration along with collective practice and performance.

Imagine if once we agree on a certain way to connect notes and colors? It can empower our music perception with vision, the main modality for most of humans. Let's try to do it now!

We're creating the visual [music theory study](./theory/index.md), that helps beginners learn complex music concepts in color. [Interactive web-apps](./practice/index.md) expand the knowledge and grow deeper music awareness.

For those, who want to touch and feel the colorful notes we have a [Sticker shop](./shop/index.md). While those who are interested in further project development may dive into [Chromatone Academy](/academy/) and also [sponsor](./support/index) [us](contacts/index.md) today.
