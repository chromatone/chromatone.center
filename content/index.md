# Visual music language to learn, explore and express with

Chromatone is an ongoing research and experiment to induce a synchronised artificial synesthesia for personal music learning and exploration along with collective practice and performance. Imagine if once we agree on a certain way to connect notes and colors? It can empower our music perception with vision, the main modality for most of humans. Let's try to do it now!

We're building a visual [music theory study](./theory/index.md), that may help beginners learn complex music concepts in color. [Interactive web-apps](./practice/index.md) expand the knowledge and grow deeper music awareness. 

For those, who want to touch and feel the colorful notes we have a [Sticker shop](./shop/index.md). While those who are interested in further project development may consider [supporting](./support/index.md) [us](contacts/author/index.md) today.
