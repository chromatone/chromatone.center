Navigating the multifarious space of pitch class combinations is a wonderful journey that may be accompanied with different tools we've made. Plot a mathematically perfect [Chroma Waveform](./waveform/index.md) of a sine wave pitch oscillations collections. 

Or just explore the collections of all possible note combinations of chroma with the [Chroma profile](./profile/index.md). Or construct any note collection with the [Chroma Compass](./compass/index.md). And in case you'll need to organize all those notes in loops in time - that's what the [Chroma grid](./grid/index.md) is designed for.

There's another endless [Chroma Roll](./gram/index.md) that will plot the relative pitch class power for any incoming audio. The same data may help you see the pitch class content of any sound with the [Chroma See](./see/index.md).
