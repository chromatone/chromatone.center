## Sequencing

**Sequencing** is the stringing together of a precisely-timed sequence of commands to the computer to make sound.

The commands can be things like “play an audio sample” or “send a note-on command on this MIDI channel to this MIDI port” or “select the instrument for a MIDI channel”. In the old days, there was a clear distinction between sequencers, which knew how to record, edit and play back sequences of MIDI commands, but had no ability to record or play back sound on their own, and sound sources, which knew how to respond to MIDI commands by producing actual sound. These days, most applications can do at least something of both. 

## Sequencers

A music sequencer is a tool that allows you to program and playback sequences of notes, rhythms, and effects automatically instead of performing or recording each part in real-time. Sequencers don’t generate their own sounds. Rather, they send MIDI and CV information to trigger other instruments or effect parameters.

When programming a sequencer, you typically have control over several things: note/pitch, note length, pattern length, velocity, effect parameters and more. In other words, sequencers allow you to program a performance over a specified period of time.

Sequencers are at the core of modern electronic music production, with arrangements built from loops of sequenced drum beats and synthesizer patterns. They’re also useful as an accompaniment for live musicians.

Sequencers take many different forms, both in music sequencer hardware and music sequencer software. External instruments like a piano can be synced with a sequencer to keep everything locked to the same tempo, while computer DAWs take non-linear composition to expansive new levels. The most common sequencers music producers use today, however, are the DAW’s piano roll and step sequencers.

## Web-apps

[Ambient drone box](./ambience/index.md) is an experiment where simplex noise meets generative music.

[Pendulums](./pendulums/index.md) are fun. Game like [Matter simulation](./matter/index.md) is even more fun. But orderly [Bouncers](./bounce/index.md) are a bit more pleasant to listen to. For weird vibes go for [Number sequences](./numbers/index.md) and English words sonification.
