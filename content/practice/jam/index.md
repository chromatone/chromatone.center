Apps for improvisational performances and casual jams. You can use our [Jam Session](./session/index.md) to display all the vital parameters of a session. Or put your device with [Jam Table](./table/index.md) app on the screen in front of your synths and players. Or press the Random button in [Random Jam](./random/index.md) app and play to a cleverly generated set of BPM, tonic note and a scale. We can add more for your need - feel free to [contact us](../../contacts/index.md).
