> I gave it a quick try and it didn't seem to work either on the referenced tonesavvy.com site or on my own velocitester.com. It only worked on the default page that simply logs the notes being played. I didn't spend time trying to debug it however.

## Looks like WebMIDI browser on iPad is finally dead after 8 years of no updates, at least for my webapp, that had 7 years of constant updates

Hi! My name is Denis and I'm the author and developer of Chromatone - the Visual Music Language online research hub. I'm building it as an open source web-app from 2017 here https://chromatone.center/ . It was a move from limitations of Wordpress to freedom of creativity with Vue, Vite, Vitepress, Tone.js, Elementary.js and, of course, WebMIDI.js. Now we're at 2.9.x version and approaching 3.0.
I started with WebMIDI even before
