The smallest piece of rhythm is just an event in time marked by any sound, [Noise](./noise/index.md) is quite nice for that.

You can organize pitches in time with a simple, yet powerful [Sequencer](./sequencer/index.md), or explore beats loops with the [Horizontal bars](./bars/index.md) or [Circlular](./circle/index.md) metronomes.
