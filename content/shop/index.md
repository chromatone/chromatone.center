It's great having all the interactive tools available online, but there are times when screen is just isn't enough. Having colorful notes directly on the keys or [frets](./fretboard/index.md) of your instrument is a great help in learning and exploring music. So we design and print high quality [vinyl stickers](./keys/index.md) for almost any use case.

And also we have prints. [Laminated memos](./memo/index.md) and cheat-sheets can lay around as you practice and grow - they're your sources of truth about the scales and modes, keys and chords. No need to memorize everything by heart or rely only on muscle memory â€“ the essense of music theory can always be in your pocket. Even offline.
