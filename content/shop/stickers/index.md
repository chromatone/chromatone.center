The first generation of instrument stickers consists of [OP-1 stickers](./op-1/index.md) and [Regular piano stickers](./piano/index.md).

The [Universal stickers](./universal/index.md) and [A5 MAX](./a5max/index.md) are newer and more evolved and may be useful for more advanced music learners and teachers.

Upgrade your [Guitar](./guitar/index.md) or [Ukulele](./ukulele/index.md) with color notes strip stickers.

The newer [A5 MULTI stickers](./a5multi/index.md) are printed on transparent vinyl and are more useful for more experienced musicians.

The holographic [Holocircle](./holocircle/index.md) is just a nice visual aid to recall all the 12 notes and colors to play with.
