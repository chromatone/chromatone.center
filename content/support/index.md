Chromatone is an open source initiative made not to be a proprietary standard, but to become a wide spread language, used by musicians, visual artists along with music gear companies and app developers all over the world.

## Follow and share

We have a subreddit to hang around and an Instagram account to tag in your posts. And it's important to let more people join the growing community of visual musicians. So follow us and spread the word about Chromatone through your social media and beyond.
