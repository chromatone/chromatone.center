Chromatone is an open source initiative and we are based on voluntary contributions of code, time and money. You can become a part of the development by even a small donation â€“ it really gives us energy to continue it further.

You can start supporting the project today by sponsoring it's author at GitHub. [Go to GutHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/chromatone/)

In future the project will grow big enough to become an Open Collective to be even more transparent about all the funding and expenses. We'll need to get at least 100 stars for [the repository at GitHub](https://github.com/chromatone/chromatone.center). Let's do it together!
