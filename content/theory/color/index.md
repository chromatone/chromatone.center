Here's very start of our journey to the visual music theory. First we learn about the phenomenon of [Light](./light/index.md), it's sources and it's main properties as an electromagnetic emission.

Then we dive deep into the physiology of [Human color perception](./perception/index.md) that defines the way we interpret colors of the nature.

[Color models](./models/index.md) study shows the research and the maths behind modern methods of reproducing any given color on the screen or on printed media.

We list 12 [Main colors names](./names/index.md) to make sure we can use them later as 12 notes correspondents.
