## Reharmonization = Chord substitution but for the whole chord progression

Reharmonization is used to:

* Make a song more ‘jazzy’ – that is, more harmonically and/or structurally complex;
* Personalise a song and make it your own (it’s almost like composing a brand new song, or a variation of an existing song).

So, generally, a song consists of a:

* Melody; and
* Chord progression

Reharmonization involves **changing the melody or chords** or both – but changing them with regard to certain rules or ideas.

To reharmonize a song you need to take two things into account:

* **Harmony**
  * This depends on the interaction between the melody and the chords
  * It depends on the quality of the chord (Maj, min, V7, etc.)
  * **Goal**: To ensure the **melody note is an ‘acceptable harmony’ over the chord**
* **Structure**
  * This refers to the movement of chords & bass-line
  * It is NOT affected by the quality of the chord
  * **Goal**: The structure must be logical.
  * In practice this means that chords and bass-lines should move:
    * by Fixed Intervals;
    * by Diatonically;
    * be Melody based.

**The Overarching Goal of Reharmonization is**:

* Change the chords and/or melody to ensure the melody is an ‘acceptable harmony’ over the chord.
* Change chords and bass-line so they move in a ‘structured way’.

## Key Melody Note

The first thing you have to do when reharmonizing a song is to identify the **Key Melody Note** (KMN) of each bar:

* The KMN is harmonically the most important note in a bar – with all the other notes treated as passing notes (so NOT harmonically important)
* This is largely subjective, but the KMN tends to be the:
  * Longest note in the bar
  * First note in the bar
  * Most repeated note in the bar
  * A note played on-the-beat
* There may be more than one KMN in a bar, in which case:
  * Account for both; or
  * Look for the KMN in each half-bar (and so on)
* There may be no obvious KMN – e.g. a fast run of notes, in this case:
  * Look at ALL or MOST of the notes in the bar
  * Structure > Harmony – more on this later

## Harmony

First let’s deal with the **Harmony**:

* Change the chord (tonality and quality) or KMN to ensure the KMN is an ‘acceptable harmony’ over the chord
* We have already learned in previous lessons that not all notes are equal. Some notes sound strong when played over a chord ([**Guide Tones**](https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-improvisation/guide-tones/)), some notes sound pleasant and complement the sound of a chord ([**Available Tensions**](https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chords/available-tensions/)), while some notes sound weak and dissonant ([**Avoid Notes**](https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-improvisation/avoid-notes/)). Well, I’ve defined ‘acceptable harmony’ as ‘guide tones’ (3rd & 7th) plus ‘available tensions’. These are the notes that sound good over a particular chord. I have allocated every note into the following categories:
  * **Strong Harmony** = Guide Tones
  * **Weak Harmony** = Root & 5th
  * **Jazzy Harmony** = Available Tensions
  * **Unacceptable Harmony** = Unavailable Tensions/Avoid Notes

Acceptable Harmony = Guide Tones + Available Tensions

Below are the Acceptable Harmonies for a number of chord types.

### Acceptable Harmonies

![How to Reharmonize a Song](https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/How-to-Reharmonize-a-Song.png)

Ok, so now let’s do the same exercise but in reverse. Instead of taking a chord and finding all its acceptable harmonies, let’s take a note and find all the chords where that note is an acceptable harmony. Let’s use the note ‘C’.

* Below, all chords that create an ‘Acceptable Harmony’ with the Key Melody Note (C) are highlighted <span style="color: #008000;">**Green**</span>.
* The tonality/root of the chord is given in the row labelled ‘Root’
* The quality of the chord is given in the rows labelled ‘Chord Quality’
* The row labelled ‘Degree’ will tell you what degree the Key Melody Note is in relation to the chord.

You can use any of the chords coloured <span style="color: #008000;">**Green**</span> above to substitute for a chord when the key melody note of a bar is ‘C’.

## Structure

Next let’s deal with the Structure:

* ‘Structure’ involves moving the **chord** and the **bass-line** in a ‘structured’ or ‘logical’ way, ignoring the quality of the chord.
* In reality this means moving the chords and bass-line in:
  * Fixed intervals;
  * Diatonically;
  * Melody based; or
  * Some other logical structure
* You can change chord inversions to create a smoother bass-line that doesn’t jump around too much
* The bass-line and chords can move in different ways as long as they are both ‘structured’

_Remember: The chords and bass-line can move independently and the chord quality doesn’t matter_

## Some Rules and Tips

* Choose chords & melody that increase and then decrease tension
  * To increase tension – use higher extensions and alterations (e.g.♭13)
  * To decrease tension – use Guide Tones (3rd & 7th) & lower extensions (e.g. 9)
* On a long melody note or repeated melody note, move through a number of chords (this makes the melody note a kind of pedal point, which sounds great)
* While ideally we should have an acceptable harmony AND a logical structure, it is possible to have one without the other:
  * You can have a weak harmony (root or 5th) if you have a strong structure (II-V); OR
  * You can have a weak structure (no pattern) if you have a strong harmony (3rd or 7th)
* If the melody is a fast run of notes with no obvious ‘key melody note’
  * Structure becomes more important than Harmony
    * Bebop songs often use fast melody runs with strong II-V structured chord progressions
  * Look at and consider all the notes in the bar
