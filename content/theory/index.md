Welcome to the main research hub for establishing the Chromatone interpretation of basic and profound music theory concepts. 

We start from the very beginning - the physical world around us and the ways we can perceive and interpret it. What is [Light and Color](./color/index.md) and how do we see it? What is [Sound](./sound/index.md) and how do we hear it? This gives us the firm foundation for building more and more intricate structures on top of it.

Some sounds are more musical than others and we soon find the importance of their frequency profile. [Notes](./notes/index.md) are born from distinguishing particular sound pitches. And then all the combinations arise.

Two notes form [Intervals](./intervals/index.md) and three or more of them from [Chords](./chords/index.md). If there's too many sounds to be played simultaneously, but still they have pleasant relations to one another, we talk about [Scales](./scales/index.md). 

Then we start organizing all these sound structures in time based on [Rhythm](./rhythm/index.md) and dive deep into [Harmony](./harmony/index.md) and [Melody](./melody/index.md) that evolve naturally to the whole [Composition](./composition/index.md) level. 

There's quite a deep research here, and there's more [External resources](./resources/index.md) to explore for those, who needs to learn even more about music theory themselves.
