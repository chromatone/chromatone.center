There's a plenty of ways to get all the notes to play with. The natural [Just intonation](./just/index.md) is based on simple ratios. If we take only one ratio of 2:3 we can construct the [Pythagorean](./pythagorean/index.md) tuning.

Logarithms are in the base of the modern [12-TET](./equal/index.md) and anyone can [compare it](./tunings/index.md) to other systems easily.
