[What is Rhythm](./study/index.md) and how does the temporal dimension of music evolve? How we can conceptualize the human [Musical time feeling](./pulse/index.md)? How can we [Count fast enough](./counting/index.md) to understand the inner relations of different rhythmic patterns?

The main concept in modern Western rhythmic tradition is the [Meters](./meter/index.md) differentiation. While there's a plenty of other [national musical time organisation systems](./system/index.md), that may emphasize some other aspects of the temporal music feel, such as [Syncopation, swing and groove](./groove/index.md).

And there's so much to explore in practice while learning basic [Drum rudiments](./rudiments/index.md) on your own.
