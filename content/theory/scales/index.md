Scales are collections of pitch classes to play together. There's a plenty of such known and used [Note combinations](./study/index.md).

Five notes is enough to construct the most simple and pleasant sounding [Pentatonic scales](./pentatonic/index.md). The most common scales nowadays are [Diatonic sets](./diatonic/index.md) of 7 notes, organized in a special way. Every note in such a scale has it's own distinct role as a [Scale degree](./degrees/index.md).

Breaking the diatonic rule the modernism era has discovered all the strange [Symmetrical scales](./symmetrical/index.md) that bring us more complex emotional effects. 

Let's not focus only on Western music theory, especially when it comes to scales. [Indian Raga](./raga/index.md) school has a much wider scope on note collections to be played and improvised over.
