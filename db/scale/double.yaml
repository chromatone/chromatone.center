This is also known as Mayamalavagowla, Bhairav Raga, Byzantine scale, Arabic (Hijaz Kar), and Gypsy major. It can be likened to a gypsy scale because of the diminished step between the 1st and 2nd degrees. Arabic scale may also refer to any Arabic mode, the simplest of which, however, to Westerners, resembles the double harmonic major scale. "

  description: "This scale (and its modes like the double harmonic scale) is one of the few perfectly balanced seven-note subsets of the equally tempered chromatic scale: when its pitches are represented as points in a circle whose full circumference represents an octave, their average position (or 'centre of mass') is the centre of the circle. Other examples include the Dorian mode of major and fifth mode of melodic minor. The axis of balance for the Hungarian minor passes through the fifth and the flat nine, which is not included in the pitch set."
