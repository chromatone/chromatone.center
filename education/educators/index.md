We're building an international community of the visual music theory teachers and practitioners. It all starts from the founder of the system and grows exponentially as a net of those who learn to see music in color. Learners become teachers with time. And the cycle goes on.

You can bring Chromatone to lectures, workshops or performances at your place. We're open to any kind of collaboration!
