## The app

Here we have the newly ported `midi-monitor`. [The first one](https://midi.chromatone.center) was [built](https://github.com/chromatone/midi-monitor) with vue 2. This one is vue 3 composition api based.

Just plug in your midi device, play it and see the notes and control changes in the monitor. Play the notes back, change the CC â€“ it works both ways.

### Roadmap
