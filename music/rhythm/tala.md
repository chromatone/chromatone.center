### Teental

Teental (alternatively spelled tintal, teentaal, or tintaal, and also called trital; Hindi: तीन ताल) is the most common tala of Hindustani Classical Music, and is used for drut (fast-tempo) structure of tintal. It is so symmetrical that it presents a very simple rhythmic structure against which a performance can be laid. It is played on Tabla as well as on Percussion instruments. 

Tintal has sixteen (16) beats in four equal divisions (Vibhag). The period between every two beats is equal. The first beat out of 16 beats is called sam and the 9th beat is called khali ('empty'). To count the Teental, the audience claps on the first beat, claps on the 5th beat, then waves on the 9th beat and lastly again claps on the 13th beat; these three claps (Hindi tin 'three' + tāl 'clap') give the rhythm its name.
