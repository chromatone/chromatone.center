This app shows the [chromagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_feature) or the [12 tone harmonic pitch class profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_pitch_class_profiles) of the incoming signal. It means is analyzes the frequency spectrum and sums them according to one of the 12 pitch classes. The relative power of every pitch class is plotted, showing the primary tones of the audio signal. Pure sine tone will give us one line filled and noise will make all the bands glow equally bright.
