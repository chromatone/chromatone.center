Experience the basic observations about sound physics and human sound perception phenomena yourself. You can build your own [Equal loudness contour](./loudness/index.md) with the tool to match any pitch and volume.

You can imagine youself exploring basic music maths with Pythagoras and his [Monochord](./monochord/index.md) without going any where in space and time. 

Visualized [String overtones](./overtones/index.md) can teach about the shapes of an oscillating string or column of air gets and how it affects the sound. And then by superimposing two complex sounds overtones we can establish the [Sensory dissonance curve](./dissonance/index.md) that lays in the basis of all modern music harmony.
