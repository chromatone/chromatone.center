> **Find your own equal loudness contour**  
> Place sine oscillators on the 2D-plane where vertical axis is the volume and horizontal is the frequency of the sounds being played. You can build up a curve for your absolute threshold of hearing, or explore your own feeling of really loud sounds. **Be careful clicking at the top of the graph!**
