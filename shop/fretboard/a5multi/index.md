The combination of 3 smaller sticker kits on a precut sheet of high quality transparent vinyl with durable UV printed colors. The colors are bright, but balanced. With this only sheet you can upgrade a whole set of instruments:

- acoustic or electric guitar
- ukulele (any kind)
- keys of a piano, synth or a MIDI-keyboard
- - some nice memos and Chromatone logos.

The paint is eco friendly, matte and very durable. No need for any kind of coating.
