High quality print on white vinyl is enough for beginner education and occasional instrument use. It's cheaper and it may show signs of wear after a couple of months of practice. But it may be desireable as it's a nice indicator of hard work and quality time invested.

Yet the [matte laminated](../) stickers are more durable under heavy practice.
