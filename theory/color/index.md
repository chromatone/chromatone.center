> **Chroma**, in reference to color, "intensity of distinctive hue, degree of departure of a color-sensation from that of white or gray," 1889, from Latinized form of Greek *khrōma* "surface of the body, skin, color of the skin," also used generically for "color" and, in plural, "ornaments, make-up, embellishments," a verbal noun from *khroizein* "to color, stain, to touch the surface of the body," *khrosthenai* "to take on a color or hue," from *khros, khroia* "surface of the body, skin."


Here's very start of our journey to the visual music theory. First we learn about the phenomenon of [Light](./light/index.md), it's sources and it's main properties as an electromagnetic emission.

> χρῶμᾰ • (khrôma) n (genitive χρώμᾰτος); third declension
> - skin (esp. the human body)
> - colour (esp. of the skin or body); pigment
> - complexion
> - character of style in writing; ornaments
> - chromatic scale; music

Then we dive deep into the physiology of [Human color perception](./perception/index.md) that defines the way we interpret colors of the nature.

[Color models](./models/index.md) study shows the research and the maths behind modern methods of reproducing any given color on the screen or on printed media.

We list 12 [Main colors names](./names/index.md) to make sure we can use them later as 12 notes correspondents. And here comes the [Modal interplay](./interplay/index.md) approach that we use to expand average human music potential with visual aid.
