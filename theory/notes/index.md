Let's first learn about [Temperaments](./temperaments/index.md) as ways to divide an octave into distinct notes to play. Then let's find out how these notes got their names with [Solmization](./solmization/index.md) and how they were written down in [National notation systems](./national/index.md). The [European tradition](./evolution/index.md) and it's [Classic staff notation](./staff/index.md) is one of the most influential worldwide, but still there's a plenty of ancient and modern [Alternative notation systems](./alternative/index.md) to explore and experiment with.
