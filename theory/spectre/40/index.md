Let take it mathematically. Acoustic oscillations frequency multiplies by to with every octave. This means we can find an imaginary pitch for any given frequency. This means we can find rythm notes and also it's another way to bring light and sound together.

Let's keep multiplying our A = 440 Hz by two until we reach the visible light spectrum – about 0.4–1 PHz. We can calculate all the notes frequencies and place them in the spectrogram. What we get is that A is near orange red, C is green and E is blue. Roughly. But If we consider a little lower base A frequency, we can see pretty nice corellation.

We can conclude that it's a fundamental property of our perception to close perceived parts of any spectrum into a seamless circle. And these circles are not just illusions as the resonances and  periodicities are based on fundamental principles of physics.
