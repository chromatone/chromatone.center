Sonic and electromagnetic waves have very different mediums as a carrier field. Sound is carried by air molecules, light travels through vacuum just because of ever present electromagnetic field.

But they're stil oscillations, so we an compare their frequencies and wavelenghts. But what to choose? Let's try both!

## Frequency

Let's start with frequencies. What is **1 Hz**? It's one oscillation per second. For EM it corresponds to radiation far in the **long radio spectrum**. We can't hear such slow air oscillations and 1 Hz is in **infrasonic** range.

This juxtaposition shows that electromagnetic and acoustic oscillations are of entirely different nature and can’t be matched just as they are. Audible frequencies of oscillating air correspond to long radio range of EM spectrum. If compared by the wavelengths our notes are situated somewhere around the FM radio range. In turn the visible light oscillations are so fast, that they can be matched only with hypersonic waves in some rigid bodies.

These oscillations are so short that they are comparable with the size of atoms in a crystal grid. The faster atoms move – the more heat they carry. A heated body starts to emit electromagnetic waves, starting from infrared and coming to the visible light range after about 1000K. So we can say, that sound and light are two main forms of oscillating energy propagation mechanics. And the similarities between them can be better justified not by their physical nature, but by the nature of human perception of them.
